<p>HI GUYS! Remember me? I was wondering if after all these years you&#8217;d like to meet and go over half a season of hockey that I&#8217;ve mostly missed. How does this happen? My life is like space in <em>Interstellar</em>, where time barely passes, while hockey and this blog remain on Earth, getting 80 years older every day without me.</p>
<p>So, All-Star Game?</p>
<p>Is anyone watching this? I kinda sorta almost totally forgot about it until someone mentioned John  Tavares&#8217; pants.</p>

<p>So, Crosby didn&#8217;t get invited. That&#8217;s old news. I wrote a mental blog post called &#8220;10 Things Sid Can Do Instead of the ASG&#8221;, which was quite funny.  You should read it sometime when you develop mind-reading powers.  Or tomorrow, if I get around to posting it.</p>
<p>The newer news is Ovi and Toews are hurt/sick and also suspended. The NHL sure knows how to cry when the whole class doesn&#8217;t come to their party.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alas, with no drunken draft, most of the fun is gone from the weekend anyway. The NHL has realized this too late and made some replacement efforts to attract our attention:</p>
<p><strong>1) Made John Tavares captain.</strong> He probably suggested this <em>Footloose</em>-inspired sobriety nonsense, for fear a real charitable organization might think Ovi was actually poor and needed a new car. The paperwork on that tax headache!  But it does mean more camera time for Captain T and the Pleated Pants.</p>

<p><strong>2) Dierks Bentley.</strong> HOLLER. I love country music, and Dierks is a big Preds fan, and everybody likes tight jeans. He&#8217;ll be one of the celeb coaches at the game.</p>

<p><strong>3) All the Foxy Fridays</strong>. Damn if they didn&#8217;t replace Toews with <a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2012/08/24/foxy-friday-james-neal/">James Neal</a>. The NHL knew I wasn&#8217;t paying attention and just waved a <del>red</del> ginger flag in my face.</p>

<p><strong>4) 3-on-3 Format.</strong> I won&#8217;t pretend to have an opinion on this, as I&#8217;ve watched approximately one OT period all season, but it sounds exciting. Top players + more open ice = more goals, right? But hasn&#8217;t the All-Star Game always ended in some Hobbit score of twelveses to eleventy anyway? Maybe the &#8220;last place in the draft&#8221; prize can be repurposed to the only player who doesn&#8217;t score a hat trick on Sunday.</p>

<p><strong>5) The John Scott story.</strong> Voted into the ASG by fans, then traded and assigned to the AHL, the saga of whether or not John Scott would appear in the ASG has been ongoing news. Yesterday, Scott published<a href="http://www.theplayerstribune.com/a-guy-like-me/"> this first person account in The Player&#8217;s Tribune</a>. In it, he explains how someone from the NHL encouraged him, even now, not to attend this weekend&#8217;s events.</p>
<p>SCREW YOU, NHL. Wrong, bad, stupid, and also, WHY? John Scott may be the only player who actually cares about this game, and you think he should stay home? Do you think the fans who voted him in should not watch? Oh no, you want them. You NEED them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read the Player&#8217;s Tribune story. It will make you want to buy a John Scott jersey and stand up in your living room when he takes the ice on Sunday. I hope every player shows up wearing his name. You may not like Scott&#8217;s brand of hockey, but it is part of hockey. Scott may not be an elite player, but he is a player. Was a player? Will be an NHL player again? Who knows. But if you love the game, you have to love it&#8217;s scars.</p>
<p>So, see you guys tomorrow night on the Twitters to techno-judge the real skills at Skills Competition: hair, beard, sass? Our trifecta of All-Star Weekend talents.</p>

<p>I recently won a <strong>Caps Ultimate Fan Experience</strong>, and took Jess as my date. The package consists of watching warm-ups from the penalty box, plus two lower-level seats. Which, after watching warm-ups from the penalty box, seem like they&#8217;re in the parking lot.</p>
<p>You can buy these ticket packages <a href="http://capitals.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=106249">here</a>. They come with a jersey and run $250+ depending on the game you want. The Stars game was lowest tier. Obviously that schedule was made last season! For a special occasion, or if you wanted to impress your hockey blogger wife (ahem), it&#8217;s pretty darned cool.</p>

<p>How are we ever going to watch warm-ups from anywhere else? Would we ever get used to pucks pinging off the glass non-stop in front of our faces? Maybe if I&#8217;d been looking at the Caps&#8217; side, I&#8217;d have seen those pucks coming. But Jamie Benn was right there.</p>

<p>We moved to our excellent 7th row seats right at the goal line where the Stars shot twice. Now, we were definitely rooting for the Caps, but the Stars have some high-powered offense and it was fun to watch Benn &amp; Seguin connect for a goal up close. If I could teleport, I would have revealed my power to the world when I popped into the middle of their hug.</p>

<p>The already epic night held two more highlights in store. First, I had the pleasure of meeting Erin (<a href="https://twitter.com/ErinMiHaley">@ErinMIHaley</a>) and Jen (<a href="https://twitter.com/jrho_jrho">@jhro_jhro</a>), and talking some hockey in real life with people I talk to on the Twitters all the time. I love this. If you ever come to Verizon, say the word and we&#8217;ll meet by the Dunkin&#8217; Donuts. (Which no longer has iced tea, so maybe we&#8217;ll meet somewhere else.)</p>

<p>The second shiny object was literally one for the record books.

<p>To round out the night &#8211; and maybe because he was afraid of Jess taking his job &#8211; Slapshot came down and paid us a visit. The Caps didn&#8217;t win the game, but we definitely had a winner of a night.</p>

<p>Since losing this game to Dallas, the Caps have won 5 straight and jumped over the NYR (<em>whoop!</em>) for first in the Metro Division. Now if only the Penguins could stop losing in OT and get those second points&#8230;.</p>

<p>Most of all you made us forget all the guys who weren&#8217;t there, from the Subban-type snubs to the Crosby-esque casualites. Maybe the weekend could have been even better&#8230; but we didn&#8217;t miss them.  So thanks for this weekend, and see you next year in Nashville. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>The NHL Awards are tonight &#8211; on a Tuesday.  Let that sink in&#8230; Tuesday.  Rock and roll.  We&#8217;ll take it, of course, desperate and starved as we are.  But not to overload Tuesday, hockey festivities began yesterday in two cities.</p>
<p>In Vancouver, Hockey Canada hosted an Olympic Gala and distributed rings.  Sid was there, opting for a brown t-shirt because he saw how excited we all got about mint green the other day.  Of course he was with Matt Duchene, who is turning turning into a country singer before our eyes.  (No complaints.)  PK puts everyone&#8217;s wardrobe to shame with zero effort.</p>

<p>I swear he owns two suits and five shirts.  When future generations of WUYS readers use the internet built into their brains to crack open the Crosby photo file, they won&#8217;t be able to tell one year from another.  His whole career is &#8220;circa navy suit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last night culminated in the Hockey Canada Gala.  PK did that thing again with his wardrobe and Carey Price loved his beard as much as we do.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s John, almost appearing again.  I don&#8217;t see a single photo of him in what I presume was a suit&#8230; not one.  Who goes an entire pride-of-the-nation event wearing a shiny new Olympic ring and does not get photographed a single time?  John Tavares, folks.</p>
<p><em>Meanwhile in Vegas&#8230;</em></p>
<p>At NHL Awards 2014, media availability, Tazer discussed contract extensions, his lifelong commitment to Patrick Kane and he even almost smiled one time [<a href="http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/console?id=625916&amp;catid=53">video</a>].</p>

<p>Giroux was there too &#8211; I tell ya, this guy could make a girl forget she hates the Flyer.  Whew.  So much so that I didn&#8217;t look at the video title and see SCOTT HARTNELL WAS TRADED [<a href="http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/console?id=625919&amp;catid=53">video</a>].  Nine hours elapsed before I found this out!  If that&#8217;s not the truest sign of summer, take back my margarita.</p>

<p>It figures that Hartnell was only traded as far as Columbus, after the time they gave the Pens these past playoffs.  Why can&#8217;t people get traded to the KHL?  At least it was a swap for RJ Umberger (what I say when I think about calories for two seconds then order what I want anyway) and not Dubinsky.  That would be from bad to worse.</p>
<p>Claude also discussed his Hart nomination [<a href="http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/console?id=625927&amp;catid=53">video</a>], which I hope he loses.</p>
<p>Ovi spent the week in Vegas posting <a href="http://instagram.com/a0gr8">drunken Instagrams</a>, then spoke about the Caps new coach [<a href="http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/console?id=625914&amp;catid=53">video</a>].  I wonder how much of the second thing had to do with so much of the first. Of course I screen capped a rather smug moment.</p>

<p>The NHL Awards broadcast tonight at 7 PM.  I am debating watching in real time or waiting until fast forward becomes an option.  My &#8220;I can&#8217;t watch <em>The Office,</em> it&#8217;s too awkward!&#8221;-phobia is at DEFCON ONE during these shows.  Either way, if I survive I will post tomorrow.  With some actual hockey content.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Someday I&#8217;ll go to a hockey team&#8217;s Casino Night.  Someday I&#8217;ll have $250 to spend on an event that doesn&#8217;t involve either Vegas or getting a tan.  Or they could move these to Vegas and I could do all three at once.</p>
<p>The Caps and Islanders hosted casino nights last night.  The events benefit wonderful charities, but &#8220;Crush on Mike Green&#8221; is not a deductible category on my taxes.  At least not when &#8220;Married, Filing Jointly.&#8221;  Perhaps in Canada you can claim &#8220;Pretending I Can Count While John Tavares Deals Blackjack.&#8221;</p>

<p>I hope John&#8217;s a slow dealer, because hockey + cocktails is already more math than I can handle.  Read about the event <a href="http://islanders.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=709247&amp;navid=DL|NYI|home">here</a> and see more photos <a href="http://islanders.nhl.com/club/gallery.htm?id=43990&amp;location=/photos&amp;pg=1">here</a>.  If there&#8217;s video later, I&#8217;ll post it.</p>

<p>The Caps don&#8217;t have a story or photos up yet.  They must&#8217;ve partied harder and the web team is sleeping it off.  Their Instagram managed a few photos:</p>

<p>I like goals and winning and the Caps need some of both very badly tonight. They&#8217;re winless in 5 games, including two shootout losses.  Ovi is a game-time decision vs. Ottawa, a game I&#8217;ll miss because I&#8217;m snowed in at home.  I will wear my Caps pajama pants though &#8211; they never get to go to games.  Or have nachos.</p>

<p>Ovi was on The Today Show yesterday, talking with Carson Daly about his starring role in the Sochi Olympics.  Most of you are probably not old or American enough to remember Carson Daly on Total Request Live but let me tell you: Chuck &amp; I would have fit right in back in the day.</p>

<p>I understand Carson now hosts a reality competition show that I don&#8217;t watch. Good for him &#8211; he survived all those shrieking teens for something.  As for interviews, he and Ovi both say &#8220;excited&#8221; as convincingly as John Tavares does, but we believe them.</p>

<p>What you should really watch &#8211; and we wish had made national TV! &#8211; is <strong><a href="http://www.monumentalnetwork.com/articles/alex-ovechkins-today-visit">this behind-the-scenes video from Caps Red Line</a></strong>.  Alex, you&#8217;re fun.  You say &#8220;excited&#8221; like you mean it and decline that makeup like a guy who makes $9 million a year and is engaged to a sassy fox.  (Side note: <a href="https://twitter.com/mkirilenko">@mkirilenko</a>, let&#8217;s be friends.)  This is the Ovi that even I cannot resist.</p>
<p>Also, Today Show anchors do a lot of hitting guests with paper &#8211; is that a thing? Just with athletes maybe.  Ovi&#8217;s into it.</p>

	That is one fewer than Mike Green took penalties, so there.  Nicky B had 5 points, because he and Mike always have to be matchy matchy.</p>

<p>Now no more of this, Mike.  The Caps have won 3 in a row and moved to 2nd in the Metropolitan Division&#8230; which is a bit like a Perfect Attendance Award, at 36 points overall, but there is still time to get hot and stay hot or just be Ovechkin.  Damn, he has a lot of goals.</p>

<p>After this awful hockey weekend, not even Mike Green getting 5 penalties in less time than it takes to make macaroni &amp; cheese can get me down.  We love you, Mike.  We even love Ovi right now.  That was a sick performance but a man so gleefully parenthetical.  Four goal games make me want to madly punctuate things in place of emoticons.</p>

<p>Read the preview <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/capitals/washington-capitals-season-preview-at-start-of-another-season-caps-goal-stays-the-same/2013/09/30/43650610-29d8-11e3-97a3-ff2758228523_story.html">here</a>.  Note the Post has the Penguins winning the East, by 1 point over the Bruins.</p>
<p>Though the Caps lost their opener vs. Chicago last night, I saw a lot of things I liked.  The power play is still gorgeous &#8211; three goals!   The boys definitely played a full 60 minutes.  Add in some very pretty passing and it was a strong show against probably the toughest team in the NHL.  Ovi had 9 shots, Green 6 and he played 26:48.  Guess he&#8217;s well rested.</p>
<p>So far, things are looking good.</p>

<p>It turns out I really miss those.</p>
<p>The NHL handed out their awards over the weekend while I had no internet and no idea it was happening.  Oh well.  My campaign for a &#8220;make up for the lockout and no All-Star Game&#8221; program involving a swimsuit competition and push-up contest apparently fell on deaf ears.</p>

	<em>Is that a tray of watches and potato pancakes?</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Mmmmmkay.  I would have gone with Crosby, but research indicates I may be biased.  Can you miss 1/4 of 1/2 of a season and still be MVP?  Fine, I guess not &#8211; but Sid only lost <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nhl/blog/eye-on-hockey/22432048/nhl-awards-alex-ovechkin-wins-third-hart-trophy-as-mvp">by 4 votes</a>.  I did admit this was the first year I have appreciated Ovi.  If this award inspires him to play like his three Hart-worthy seasons (instead of last season!) in the future, it&#8217;s cool by me.</p>
<p>John Tavares, what do you think?</p>

<p><strong>Selke/Best Defensive Forward &#8211; Jonathan Toews</strong></p>

<p>Approved.  Chuck would say Bergy but with the season the Hawks had, seeing one of their lead offensive players (T-1st in team goals, 2nd in points) also be their best defensive forward is especially impressive.  Why work that hard when you&#8217;re winning all the time anyway?  Because it&#8217;s a huge part of how you win all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Lady Byng/Sportsmanship &#8211; Marty St. Louis</strong></p>

<p>HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SQUISHY!!  He&#8217;s 38 today.  It&#8217;s easy to assume Squishy wins this award (almost) every year because he&#8217;s small.  Not true.  Brad Marchand is small.  You with me?  St. Louis also lead the NHL in points &#8211; at 37, he was the oldest player to ever do this.  Score that much and be nice about it? Our moms are so proud.</p>

<p>In a world where Bobrovsky was traded and now the Flyers will buyout Bryzgalov&#8217;s monster contract, are you laughing a little?  I&#8217;m laughing.  I also applaud Bob&#8217;s gutsy choice of suit and tie.  Gotta be sauve when you&#8217;re up against King Henrik.</p>

<p>I know voting only takes regular season into account, but if this went to Kris Letang after the Pens&#8217; playoffs even I would have been ashamed.  Maybe next year, Tanger.  Maybe you need a ponytail holder.  I don&#8217;t like Subban but I&#8217;d like him if he were on my team.  <a href="http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/console?catid=53&amp;id=185521">All those chin-ups</a> with the 100 lb. of extra weight have paid off.</p>

<p>I saw maybe 3 Panthers games all year and Huberdeau scored in all of them so I&#8217;m on board with this.  Jon also has the appropriately wry jawline and poufy hair potential to replace Matt Smith as <em>Doctor Who</em>, if they could tape only in summer.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay/Most Outstanding Player (by NHLPA) &#8211; Sidney Crosby</strong></p>

<p>Being voted Most Outstanding by fellow players in pretty great.  Sid would rather have the Cup, the Richard, the Hart&#8230; but this award <em>is</em> this season for Sid, especially with his injury.  I&#8217;m not going to gush.  Just sum up my feelings with the time Sid went to a Justin Beiber concert in the same week I went to a Justin Beiber concert.  I love everything.  Hold it together, girls.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16847" alt="sid beiber" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sid-beiber.jpg" width="392" height="236" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sid-beiber.jpg 560w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sid-beiber-300x180.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sid-beiber-500x300.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now, is this really necessary?</p>
<div style="width: 662px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://a3.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/316860_10150338027797466_61652252465_8442936_1715163388_n.jpg" alt="" width="652" height="367" /><p class="wp-caption-text">More for me to share with ladies. hahahahahaha!</p></div>
<p>Isn&#8217;t one Ovi enough?</p>
<p>If your name is DawnCherrie, probably not, but for the rest of us, we&#8217;re cool with just the one. Thanks so much.</p>
<p>Now don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; I think that Ovechkin is a crazy good hockey player.  He&#8217;s flashy, dynamic, and ALWAYS looks like the kid having the most fun out there when he scores goals.</p>
<div style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://sports.espn.go.com/photo/2008/0604/nhl_g_ovechkin_celebrate_300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">HUGS FOR EVERYONE!</p></div>
<p>Speaking of goals&#8230;</p>
<p>They haven&#8217;t exactly been coming fast and furious for Ovechkin.  He has the same amount of goals (3) as Mike Green.  <strong>Mike Green, people</strong>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s cool though.  While teams are busy covering the Russian Machine, it gives opportunities to guys like Green, Ward, Backstrom, Chimera, Johansson, and Wideman to create plays and score points.</p>
<p>And any time Mike Green scores, Pants does this&#8230;.</p>
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lq3fk3wkS01qbqjva.gif" alt="" width="500" height="254" /><p class="wp-caption-text">from http://burningupthesuntosaygoodbye.tumblr.com/</p></div>
<p>The Caps are 7-0 on the season and fans are no doubt dreaming that this might be the year.</p>
<p><strong>And it very well could be.</strong>   They are always considered a top team in the NHL and with good reason.  They have depth, skill, and with the addition of Tomas Voukon between the pipes, the Caps are built like a Stanley Cup contender.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So any of our loyal readers out there know that this blog &#8211; and this feature, in particular &#8211; tend to focus on the more beautiful aspects of the game of hockey.</p>
<p>Namely, the <strong>oily bo-hunks</strong> that play this game we love so much.</p>
<p><strong><a title="Foxy Friday: Patrick Sharp" href="http://whatsupyasieve.wordpress.com/2010/10/29/foxy-friday-patrick-sharp/">Patrick Sharp.  </a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Patrick Sharp.</strong></p>
<p>Oh wait, already said him.  Doesn&#8217;t matter! <strong> He&#8217;s so hot, I had to mention him twice.</strong></p>

<p>But for today&#8217;s Foxy Friday feature (yay alliteration!), I&#8217;m going a little crazy.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to veer of this highway of &#8220;hotness&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;down the off-ramp&#8230;</p>
<p>For this week, and this week ONLY- Foxy Friday is going to known as&#8230;</p>
<h3><strong>Fugly Friday</strong></h3>
<p>Yah, that&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>These guys might not gracing the cover of GQ anytime soon, but they still play a pretty sick game of hockey.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, I&#8217;m going THERE &#8230;AGAIN.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a direct quote from for NHL guidelines with regards to player contact with fans.</p>
<p>Following is an excerpt from the section that addressed &#8220;Contact with Fans&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;Under no circumstances are Club personnel &#8212; either players or non-players &#8212; permitted to have physical contact with fans, or enter, or attempt to enter the stands. Even where a fan is verbally abusive, intoxicated, or profane, Club personnel should either ignore the conduct or, where appropriate, seek the assistance of police or security personnel at the arena.</p>
<p>&#8220;Accordingly, please be on notice that all Club personnel (management, coaches, trainers, and/or players) who engage in any form of physical contact with fans, including the squirting of water, will, on a going forward basis, be subject to discipline in the form of a suspension.&nbsp; The Club involved will also be subject to a fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, Pants knows from various off-line chats&nbsp;we have, well, let&#8217;s just say I an active imagination and maybe some NSFW&nbsp;comments. But what if say Pants, or Chuck or I, were to&nbsp;lure one of our favorite players away before, during or after a game but still on-site would they still be fined for contact with a fan? Does this cover that kind of contact? What if it&#8217;s consensual? Because if I got that close to Ovi,&nbsp;&nbsp;Miika, Brodeur&nbsp;or Fedorov, I&#8217;m pretty sure it would look something like this:</p>

<p>There has been enough bashing today  and I will give Max props for being hot &#8211; there I said it. He&#8217;s HOT.  Even I can  appreciate a hot hockey player as long as his mouth is, well,  I guess  it wouldn&#8217;t work if I duct taped his mouth shut &#8211; huh?! And  he&#8217;s  French, which is another strike against him but oh well. He is hot  and  I&#8217;ll leave it at that.</p>

<p>Besides, I won&#8217;t mention, that again, the only picture  any one can find of Sidney Crosby is yet again, with a guy &#8211; a hot guy,  but a guy none the less. Oops, sorry. I digressed.</p>
<p>I am now waiting by my mail box for my sparkly (which I HOPE is  bedazzled with genuine Swarovski crystals!) Caps Lucky tank top and my  Ovechkin Women&#8217;s Green St. Patrick&#8217;s Day shirt &#8211; which, if it&#8217;s coming  UPS Ground &#8211; <strong>MIGHT</strong> be here by the next St. Patrick&#8217;s Day.</p>
<p>But <em>that</em> is another story for another day which I will only  add &#8211;  I left on the NHL shop&#8217;s website because they bugged me for feedback.  BTW &#8211; I think they got a good  laugh that day and decided to call me only to see if I truly existed as  well as my dead, blind, crippled, paralyzed grandma.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note from Pants:</strong></em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m pulling editorial and posting this, because it&#8217;s too weird!  <strong>I am wearing the Crosby version of that St. Patrick&#8217;s Day shirt right now.</strong></em> Wonder twins activate?  For Jello wrestling during the Winter Classic?</p>
