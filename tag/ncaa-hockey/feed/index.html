<p>Luckily, Sunday was the unofficial start of the Boston University Men&#8217;s Hockey season.  Although college hockey will never be the NHL, it is a very welcome and satiating alternative, especially at BU.</p>
<p>You see, BU Hockey is one of <strong>the</strong> premier college hockey programs in the country.  It has produced countless numbers of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_University_hockey#Terriers_in_the_NHL">NHL stars</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_University_hockey#BU_Terriers_on_the_1980_U.S._Olympic_Hockey_team"> Olympic medal winners</a>, and All-Americans.  They won national championships, the most recent in 2009 in what can only be describe as an &#8220;epic OT win&#8221;.</p>
<p>Three years later and I still get goosebumps every time I see this clip.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/3GU6D3oSAug?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>Additionally, BU is a member of <a href="http://www.hockeyeastonline.com/men/index.php">Hockey East</a> which includes Boston College, Maine, University of New Hampshire, and UMass (Lowell &amp; Massachusetts), who have also produced NHL-caliber talent.  Add in Notre Dame next season and you&#8217;d be hard pressed to find a more competitive and prestigious conference in NCAA Hockey.</p>
<p>But the thing I love most about college hockey is the &#8220;Before They Were Famous&#8221; cache.  You have a chance to watch players grow &#8211; not only physically but in their understanding of the game of hockey.</p>
<p>Their passes become sharper, their slapshots more accurate, their hits harder.  And then for the lucky few who do make it into the NHL, you gets to say &#8220;I saw them when&#8221;.</p>
<p>When they make it to the NHL, you cheer them on, even when they play for your arch rival.</p>
<p>You always write them in on the All-Star ballot, even if they have no chance of making it.</p>
<p>BU had a rough go of it in the off-season with major internal drama and the loss of key players.  The team has 9 freshman, include 2 goalies who will fight for the starting job, but watching them on Sunday, I&#8217;m filled with a tentative optimism for the season ahead.</p>
<p>Alot can happen in college hockey. The pendulum can swing from one extreme to another over the course of a season, a game, or even a period.</p>
<p>College hockey might be an imperfect game but it is exciting, entertaining, and passionate.</p>
<p>And right now, it&#8217;s the only game I got.</p>
