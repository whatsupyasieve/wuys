<p>I have to admit it was pretty rough for me there for a while.</p>
<p>Last Saturday, there I was &#8211; curled up in the fetal position, buried under a mound of covers, empty box of coconut milk ice cream sandwiches by my bed.</p>

<p>My beloved Bruins had just dropped Game #2 (at HOME) to the hated Habs.  I was left a shell of my former self.  <strong>Defeated.  Dejected.  Despondent.</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>Bruins</strong> kicked me square in the gut, knocking the wind right out of me. I felt like I did when I asked a boy to dance with me in junior high and he rejected me.  It could have been that because I was a foot taller than him.  That really sucked.</p>
<div style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i.ehow.com/images/a05/e0/g9/date-guy-shorter-1.4-800X800.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="169" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Welcome to my life, people.</p></div>
<p>Going into Game #3 last night, I was cautiously optimistic. This season, the Bruins have been a slightly better team on the road than they were at home and I had hope that they could go up to Montreal and &#8220;find themselves&#8221; like a college student on a gap year.</p>
<p>Coach Claude packed up the team and carted them off to practice in <a href="http://bruins.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=60411&amp;navid=DL|BOS|home">historic Lake Placid, NY &#8211; the home of the &#8220;Miracle on Ice&#8221; </a>and to escape the media scrutiny in Boston and Montreal.</p>
<div style="width: 413px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" " src="http://www.onfrozenblog.com/files/2007/02/miracle_on_ice-eruzione_goal_celebration.jpg" alt="" width="403" height="399" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Do you believe in Miracles??</p></div>
<p>An interesting move, no doubt designed to inspire his team to hockey greatness and perhaps absorb some of the victory vibes in the Field House.</p>
<p>The Bruins came into the Bell Centre needed to win this game or be faced with almost certain elimination and the scorn of thousands of Bruins fans every so hopeful that this year could be the year.  40 years is a looooong time to wait&#8230;especially in a city that has seen so many championships lately from their other sports teams.</p>
<p><strong>Well, they won.</strong>  (*sigh of relief*)  They pounced on Carey Price early and scored 3 goals.  The Habs came back in tenacious fashion to bring it within 1, but Timmy Thomas stepped up and was stellar in the 3rd period. (<a href="http://video.bruins.nhl.com/videocenter/console?hlg=20102011,3,133&amp;event=MTL97">Click here to see game highlights!</a>)</p>
<p>He turned away countless shots, make great saves and put himself back on the path of redemption after two terrible games in Boston.  Chara was also back after a bout with the flu and you could tell that the team had missed his imposing presence.</p>
<p>So that being said I&#8217;m feeling <em>slightly</em> better than I did last week&#8230;but still not 100%.</p>
<p><strong>Think Zdeno will share his saltines and ginger ale with me?</strong></p>
