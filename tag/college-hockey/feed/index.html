				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little over twelve hours later and I&#8217;m still coming to grips with what happened yesterday.  Yes, the Bruins lost and will miss the playoffs for the first time in almost 10 years. But honestly, that is not what as me feeling this way.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Boston University Terriers lost a heartbreaker in the finals of the NCAA Men&#8217;s Ice Hockey Championship.  Victory was snatched from them in a matter of minutes.  One tiny miscue.  Then one goal.  And it was all over.</p>
<p>I was gutted. Totally and utterly gutted.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve watched this team all season and I can honestly say that I have not seen a group like this in a long time. The &#8217;09 team was an impressive group, to be sure.  But this team &#8211; there was an intangible, indescribable &#8220;something.&#8221;   I could try finding the words to define it but I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d do it any true justice.</p>
<p>The arrival of  <strong>Jack Eichel</strong> and an impressive group of freshman started the turn around for a team what was abysmal last season.  As the media hype swirled around Eichel, players like <strong>Brandon </strong><strong>Fortunato, Brandon Hickey,  John MacLeod, Nikolas Olsson, and A.J. Greer</strong> wove their way into the fabric of this storied hockey program. Returning forwards like <strong>Danny </strong><strong>O&#8217;Regan,</strong> <strong>Evan Rodrigues</strong>, and <strong>Ahti Oksanen</strong> put up offensive numbers that name BU the top-scoring team in the nation.  <strong>Doyle Somerby </strong>become a blue-line force, providing physicality and big hits in equal measure.</p>
<p>There is no dispute that Eichel brought a prestige and a impressive skill set to this storied program.  Yes, he was the best player in the country. Yes, he did win the Hobey Baker. Yes, watching him skate and play was a thing of beauty.</p>
<p>But what he really brought was a belief in himself and his ability which permeated every other other player in that locker room. It extended out and touch every player wearing that scarlet and white sweater.</p>
<p>However, no talented team is complete without goaltending and this year, <strong>Matt O&#8217;Connor</strong> was outstanding.  He became the undisputed starter and stepped into the role with a maturity and a focus.</p>
<p>Yesterday, he made one mistake. <strong>But yesterday will not and should not define him nor his hockey career.</strong>  My hope is that those 15 or so NHL clubs that showed so much interest in him this season don&#8217;t turn away because if they do, they could miss out on something special.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Connor is an exceptional student and a class act of a human being.  His coaches and teammates think the world of him.  He answered question after question from the media, still clad in his gear.  He told the story over and over again although I&#8217;m sure he would have preferred to be left alone.   The disappointment he and his team must be feeling overwhelms me and I&#8217;m sure every member of Terrier Nation.</p>
<p>But that is just what happens when you love and appreciate a team this much.  It has been a true joy to watch them play this season. Any one who knows the true me, knows that my love of hockey is true and deep and real.  And my profound love for BU Hockey is its core.</p>
<p>This Terrier team may have missed out on a National Championship but I do not and cannot believe that it will be their last opportunity. Hockey is infused in every cell of their bodies.  It feeds them and sustains them and it is a hunger that will not be satiated until they hold that trophy in their hands.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you read this blog with any regularity you know that Pants and I love us some Boston University (#ScarletAndWhiteForLife) &#8211; we are proud alumnae after all &#8211; and for the last few years,  I&#8217;ve been a BU Hockey season ticket holder.  (Section 112, represent).</p>
<p>While the focus of this blog is primarily the NHL, I like try to mix it up and occasionally espouse the joys of college hockey &#8211; it is after all where some of the games best players get their start.</p>

<p>This weekend, the Boston University Terriers began their 2014-2015 season  with a 12-1 drubbing of St. Thomas University (from New Brunswick).</p>
<p>Yes, you read that correctly.  12 to 1. The Terriers scored a dozen goals. Okay, so maybe the St. Thomas University Tommies (natch) were they most stellar of the teams, but still. The only time I&#8217;ve ever seen a dozen of anything in a hockey rink is that time Pants and I got fined a dozen donuts for skipping an intramural broomball game.</p>

<p>This weekend also marked the debut of wunderkid Jack Eichel.  Never heard of him?  Well you soon will.  That&#8217;s because he is projected to be the #1 draft pick in this year&#8217;s NHL Draft.  (Last time #1 pick was a BU kid was Rick Dipietro in 2000 and we all know how that ended.)</p>

<p>Since making his name with the USA Hockey development program and winning gold at last year&#8217;s World Junior Championships, hockey pundits and NHL scouts have been touting the 17 year old Jack Eichel as the new face of American hockey.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the next Patrick Kane,&#8221; they say.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next Evgeni Malkin,&#8221; they say.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next Bill S. Preston, Esquire,&#8221; I say.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m typically not one to buy into all the hype until I&#8217;ve actually seen someone play, but after seeing Eichel this weekend, I can totally see that they were talking about.</p>
<p>
		<span class="pibfi_pinterest ">
		<img class="aligncenter" src="https://38.media.tumblr.com/119e08ec299f264fc9ce6fd1f02b2784/tumblr_nchnnsLHEI1sao59co1_400.gif" alt="" width="400" height="212" />

<p>In his first game in the scarlet and white, Eichel skated on the 1st line and had 5 assists.  Watching him play, you know that the kid has that something, that intangible, undefinable hockey &#8220;thing&#8221;.</p>
<p>
		<span class="pibfi_pinterest ">
		<img class="aligncenter" src="https://33.media.tumblr.com/d639aea7f21277f0ff6bc77025942a67/tumblr_mkacbc9SZq1rfpp1do1_400.gif" alt="" width="400" height="305" />

<p>His skill was excellent and his skating explosive.  Two strides and he was past the defender.  Two more strides and he was through the neutral zone, puck on his stick, then a quick dish to his linemate for the score.</p>
<p>At 6&#8217;2&#8243; and about 195 lbs, Eichel has the size to be a NHL player.   A couple of years playing in a prestigious program like BU and in what is arguably the most competitive league in the college hockey will situate Eichel to make that jump to the NHL.</p>
<p>But Eichel is just one piece of the puzzle. This weekend, the Terriers dressed 10 freshman.  New coach cleaned house in the off-season to build a team that fit into his coaching style and his ideals of what a student-athlete should be.</p>
<p>The Terriers &#8211; and college hockey- is all about potential. It is about the potential that these young men have to fulfill their childhood dreams and make it to the NHL.</p>
<p>Some, like Jack Eichel, will make it. Some will not. Maybe they&#8217;ll become coaches.  Or scouts. Or simply return to their hometowns and become beer-league all-stars. Maybe some walk away from the sport all together after their college playing days are over and get married and raise a family. Whatever their path might be, these young men will be better men for having played college hockey.</p>
<p>So I guess the moral of this post is that if you happen live in an area that has college hockey, go and watch some games.    The games are seriously affordable and highly entertaining.  I seriously doubt you&#8217;ll be disappointed.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re lucky, the rink will sell beer like mine does.</p>

<p>This year, <a href="http://www.goterriers.com">Boston University</a> has a corps of nine freshman looking to make their mark on the Terriers and Hockey East.  The five forwards, two defensemen and two goaltenders come to Comm Ave. with very high expectations.</p>
<p>No doubt the story of the season will be the two freshman goaltenders &#8211; <strong>Matt O&#8217;Connor and Sean Maguire</strong>.  Both are big netminders &#8211; O&#8217;Connor is Pekka Rinne-sized at 6&#8217;5&#8243;, 201lbs and Maguire is no slouch either at 6&#8217;2&#8243;, 202lbs.</p>
<p>They probably could stand to<strong> hit up Rhett&#8217;s or Cranberry Farms</strong> at the Student Union just a little more frequently, but we highly suggest taking advantage of BU&#8217;s excellent strength and conditioning program.</p>
<p>We also suggest filming said strength and conditioning workouts and posting them on the interwebs.</p>
<p>You know how we feel about hockey workout videos.</p>

<p><em>Following s statistical info taken from www.goterriers.com</em></p>
<p><strong>Matt O&#8217;Connor<br />
G • 6-5 • 195 • Toronto, Ont. • Youngstown Phantoms (USHL)</strong><br />
Spent last two seasons with Youngstown, helping Phantoms reach 2012 USHL Eastern Conference semifinals &#8230; Finished 2011-12 season with a record of 28-16-5, a 3.04 goals-against average and a .902 save percentage &#8230; Tied for second in the league in wins and was second in saves (1350) &#8230; Spent two years in OJHL with Upper Canada Patriots and Burlington Cougars &#8230; Posted .903 save percentage in 2009-10 &#8230; Was OJHL&#8217;s only 16-year-old goalie in 2008-09 for expansion Upper Canada club.</p>
<p>Parker on O&#8217;Connor: <em>&#8220;Matt&#8217;s another goalie with great size. He was the backstop of a pretty good USHL team, but he was the go-to guy for that team. He saw a lot of pucks. He had a real good career there, and despite an injury that kept him back a little bit, he emerged as one of the premier goalies in the league. We&#8217;re confident that he and Maguire can give us a one-two punch right off the bat.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>Sean Maguire<br />
</strong><strong>G • 6-2 • 202 • Powell River, B.C. • Powell River Kings (BCHL)</strong></p>
<p>Played two seasons with Powell River, posting a record of 27-15-1 with a 2.39 goals-against average and a .910 save percentage in 52 games &#8230; Guided team to BCHL finals this past season and back-to-back Coastal Conference titles &#8230; Named a 2012 Second Team All-Star &#8230; Backstopped Team Canada West to a gold medal at the World Junior A Challenge in November and was named tournament&#8217;s top goaltender &#8230; Two-time co-winner of the BCHL&#8217;s Wally Forslund Memorial Trophy (lowest combined GAA) &#8230; Selected by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the fourth round (113th overall) in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft.</p>
<p>Parker on Maguire: <em>&#8220;Maguire&#8217;s a big guy who fills a lot of the net and he&#8217;s got a lot of talent. He had a real good junior career in Canada. We&#8217;ve known him for a couple of years and really like him. We knew we were coming to this point where we were losing two senior goalies and we were very fortunate to get him.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>And if that wasn&#8217;t enough, they are also both<strong> celebrity doppelgängers!   </strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With a NHL lockout looming, we have a feeling that we&#8217;re going to be watching a lot more college hockey this season.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a BU season ticket holder for years now, so I&#8217;ve always been a big fan of the college game.  There are so many great reasons to watch college hockey (especially BU), but if you don&#8217;t believe me, just watch <strong>this <a href="http://www.hockeybuzz.com/blog.php?post_id=46229">video</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Two words for you: Eskimo Kisses.</p>

<p>This bromance between <strong>Ben Rosen</strong> (twitter: <a href="http://www.twitter.com/brosen8">@brosen8</a>) and<strong> Sean Escobedo</strong> (twitter: <a href="http://www.twitter.com/seanesco21">@seanesco21</a>) might be the most epic in college hockey.  And you all know how we feel about bromances here at WUYS.</p>
<p>Not only do Ben and Sean (AKA Rosenbedo) give each other eskimo kisses but they sleep over each other&#8217;s houses, have every class together, know each other&#8217;s favorite snacks, and watch &#8220;The Office&#8221; together every Thursday. The list is endless.</p>
<p>Sean also reminds me of mini Brian Boyle (SANTA!), which we all know is not a bad thing.</p>

<p>The video is a little long (it&#8217;s a whole Newlyweds-style game show also feature former BU captain Chris Connolly and new team captain Wade Megan) but it <strong>totally worth watching</strong> if you want a good giggle.</p>
<p>There is something endearing to see future NHLers being completely hilarious and ridiculous.</p>

<p>For the first and second Mondays of February, the four Boston* college hockey teams &#8211; Harvard, Northeastern, Boston College, and Boston University &#8211; take part in the<strong> Beanpot Tournament</strong>.  This special hockey tournament has grown to be one of the most unique and anticipated college sporting events in the country.</p>
<p>Winning the silver pot of Boston baked beans is a source of immense pride and bragging rights amongst players, students, alumni, and fans &#8211; especially for those of us with ties to Boston University (ie. myself and Pants). In the 59 years that the Beanpot has been played, the BU Terriers have won it <strong>29 times</strong>.  That&#8217;s about 50%.  Hence the nickname.</p>

<div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter" style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter" style="text-align:left;">BU could be considered to be in a &#8220;rebuilding&#8221; phase and have lost all their games vs. the Eagles.  BC is the defending national champs and atop the national rankings.  But when the puck drops for their semifinal match up at 8pm tonight, all the trials and tribulations of the current season don&#8217;t matter.  BU has got history on their side.  For many of BU&#8217;s players this year, this is the first time that they will playing in the Beanpot.  I hope they take a moment in the quiet before the national anthem to reflect on that this tournament means.   I hope they take a deep breath before the puck drop to realize how much this means to their fans.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a hockey fan living in New England, it is virtually impossible not to be a fan of or follow college hockey.  After all, Hockey East is arguably THE most competitive conference in Division I college hockey.  Since 1993, Hockey East teams have won 7 National Championships (and the last 3 in a row!) Can you say &#8220;Domination&#8221;?</p>
<div id="attachment_2425" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/bu-2009-ncaa-title.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2425" title="Boston University Terriers celebrate their men's NCAA Frozen Four hockey championship over the Miami University RedHawks in Washington" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/bu-2009-ncaa-title.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="190" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/bu-2009-ncaa-title.jpg 610w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/bu-2009-ncaa-title-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Winner Winner Chicken Dinner</p></div>
<p>When I was an undergraduate at <a href="http://www.bu.edu" target="_blank">Boston University</a>, my winter social life pretty much revolved around the Terriers&#8217; hockey schedule.  Hockey game, party on West Campus, recover, rinse, repeat.  I sat in Section 8 of the old <a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/54/150801810_3457c020c8.jpg" target="_blank">Walter Brown Arena</a>, where the seating bowl was weirdly elevated so that when I stood up from my 2nd row seats, my head was completely above the board.  While definitely unsafe (errant puck to the head, anyone?), it did make for an unimpeded vocal corridor right to the opposing team&#8217;s sieve..er&#8230;goalie.</p>
<p>Section 8 was especially adept at taunting these poor souls.  We had a knack for coming up with very creative insults and epitaphs to hurl at the visitor&#8217;s goalie.  My personal favorite (coined by some drunk dude in the 4th row) &#8211; &#8220;Your grandmother doesn&#8217;t love you.&#8221;  Another favorite wast the &#8220;Ugly Goalie&#8221; chant.  [Every time the opposing goalie would take off his mask, our crowd would yell &#8220;UGLY GOALIE!&#8221; over and over again.  Then when he&#8217;d put his mask back on, the crowd would cheer &#8220;YAY!&#8221;]</p>
<p>Random?  Yes.</p>
<p>Juvenile?  Maybe.</p>
<p>Effective?  You betcha.</p>
<div id="attachment_2424" style="width: 247px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/2-angry-grandmother-27397.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2424" title="Grandma" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/2-angry-grandmother-27397.jpg?w=237" alt="" width="237" height="300" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/2-angry-grandmother-27397.jpg 394w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/2-angry-grandmother-27397-237x300.jpg 237w" sizes="(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">You make her feel shame.  Disappointment and shame.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>On more than one occasion, an opposing goalie would hear one of these jeering affronts and quizzically look to his right.  Yeah, that&#8217;s right, buddy.  We&#8217;re talking about you.</p>
<h2><strong>SIEVE!</strong></h2>
<p>The team has since departing the charming Walter Brown and moved into the swanky Agganis Arena.  The seats are more comfortable and less precariously situated.  Section 8 has morphed into 2 spirited student sections at each end of the ice, but the cheers remain as lively and clever as ever.  I&#8217;ve been a  season ticket holder since my undergraduate years (minus a 4 year stint when I was living in LA) and I don&#8217;t think that I will every give up my seats.</p>
<p>College hockey is too special to give them up.  Special because you get to see players grow and develop.  You see their progression from skinny 4th-line  freshman to Hobey Baker finalist to NHL star.  College hockey is an imperfect game.  The goalie is not going to make every save.  The forward is not always going to score on the breakaway.  The defensemen is not always going to land that perfectly timed hip check.</p>
<p>But it is because of these imperfections of the college game that make it so enjoyable to watch. You feel like are a part of something just on the brink.  You are witness to these players on the edge of the diving board, ready to make the leap into the deep end of the hockey pool.</p>
<p>I, for one, cherish this and it makes me proud to be a college hockey fan.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We here at WUYS are fans of all sort of hockey teams &#8211; mites, squirts, bantam, college, professional, beer league.  No matter where you are in the world, if you&#8217;re playing hockey, we&#8217;re cheering for you.</p>
<p>So we wanted to give a big shout out to the <a href="http://www.ugahockey.com/">University of Georgia Ice Dawgs</a> for keeping it real and spreading the hockey love all over the South.  I happen to meet two of the players (Bill and Brian?) on Saturday while they were selling t-shirts to raise money for their team.   I bought one and thought I&#8217;d give them a little plug on this little blog of ours.</p>
<p>Now they may only be a club team at a school where football is a religion, but we give them mad props.  Keep at it, boys!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fall is upon us.  The leaves are turning.  The air is crisp.  It can mean only one thing&#8230;it&#8217;s time for another glorious season of college hockey!</p>
<div id="attachment_484" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/bright_crowd-225.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-484" title="Bright_Crowd-225" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/bright_crowd-225.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="180" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/bright_crowd-225.jpg 700w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/bright_crowd-225-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Even the smart kids are crazy about college hockey!</p></div>
<p>Over the next two weeks,  I&#8217;ll break down each conference and tell you who to watch throughout the country this year en route to the national title game in Minnesota.  We&#8217;ll also make some predictions with the WUYS staff and see who can pick this season&#8217;s national champ.  Today in part one we&#8217;re going west young man, and looking at the Western Collegiate Hockey Association.</p>
<p>The WCHA has an impressive history when you consider that since 1951, teams from the WCHA have earned 36 NCAA national championships and finished as the runner-up another 27 times.  That&#8217;s a lot of hardware (see below).</p>

<p>Last season, four teams from the WCHA went to the national tournament: Denver, Wisconsin, North Dakota and St. Cloud State, with Wisconsin the eventual runner-up to Boston College (I hate the Eagles!) for the national title.</p>
<p>Look for North Dakota to be strong out of the gate.  With a great defensive unit anchored by  Captain <strong>Chay Genoway</strong>, the Fighting Sioux will be tough to beat.  It&#8217;s not an accident that ND is ranked No. 2 in the national preseason polls.   This team has the potential to dominate the conference and will be a serious contender in Minnesota come Frozen Four time.</p>
<p>Minnesota-Duluth has great scoring ability and should do well this year also.   Ranked No. 9 in the preseason polls, the Bulldogs return 20 letter-men, including five of their six top scorers from last year. The  star of that group, All-American center <strong>Jack Connolly</strong> (18G-31A-49P) is poised to take the Bulldogs to new heights this year.</p>
<div id="attachment_483" style="width: 182px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/connolly_j9881.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-483 " title="Connolly_J9881" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/connolly_j9881.jpg?w=172" alt="" width="172" height="300" /></a><br />
<p class="wp-caption-text">UMD Standout Jack Connolly</p></div>
<p>St. Cloud State will sport solid  goal tending in their <strong>Lee-Dunn</strong> tandem.  However, with the loss of <strong>Ryan Lasch</strong> (20G-29A-49P), the Huskies could struggle to find enough offense this season.  The Huskies do return a large crop of upperclassmen and that experience should make them one of the teams to beat in the conference.</p>
<p>If <strong>Jaden Schwartz</strong> is everything he&#8217;s advertised as, Colorado College could have a very good year.  Schwartz, the WCHA Preseason Rookie of the Year, was also selected in the first round of the NHL draft by the St. Louis Blues.</p>
<div id="attachment_482" style="width: 218px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/schwartz.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-482 " title="Schwartz" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/schwartz.jpg?w=208" alt="" width="208" height="300" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/schwartz.jpg 413w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/schwartz-208x300.jpg 208w" sizes="(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jaden Schwartz - The Answer?</p></div>
<p>The Tigers are loaded with forwards, some proven, some raw recruits.  That being said, defense could be an issue with so many talented offensive teams in the conference.</p>
<p>The Denver Pioneers look to be in a bit of a rebuilding season as they lost many players from last year.  Picked 11th nationally in preseason polls, DU will look to build around a solid defensive corps that includes sophomore <strong>Matt Donovan</strong>.  The Pioneers will be tested early as they open their home schedule against defending NCAA champion Boston College (did I mention I hate BC?) with a pair of games October 15-16.</p>
<p>Bimidji State is new to the conference this season, but this is the team that shocked the hockey establishment a couple of years ago by advancing to the Frozen Four.  With a 23-10-4 record  overall last season in the CHA, the WCHA coaches poll has BS finishing in the bottom tier of the conference in 9th place.  I have to agree.</p>
<p>Nebraska-Omaha is the other new team this year and are a bit of an unknown.  They will retain most of their offensive firepower from last year, but defensively they could struggle.  Don&#8217;t expect them to finish any higher than 7th this season.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Golden Gophers, once a feared team and in the national consciousness has lost a bit of its bite int he last few years.  The coaches poll has them finishing squarely int he middle of the pack in 5th place.  Minnesota&#8217;s<strong> Nick Bjugstad</strong> did receive a vote for preseason rookie of the year.  Coach Don Lucia could surprise some folks this year out west and the Gophers could find themselves in the mix come playoff time.</p>
<p>Wisconsin will surprise me if they spend any time in the top half of the conference.  The national runners-up lost seven of their best players last year and you just can&#8217;t replace that kind of talent overnight.</p>
<div id="attachment_486" style="width: 136px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/wisconsinbadgers.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-486" title="WisconsinBadgers" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/wisconsinbadgers.jpg?w=232" alt="" width="126" height="164" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/wisconsinbadgers.jpg 325w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/wisconsinbadgers-232x300.jpg 232w" sizes="(max-width: 126px) 100vw, 126px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This badger looks tough...</p></div>
<p>Minnesota State will struggle to put the puck in the net as they lose almost all of their top scorers from last season.  They will stay toward the bottom this year.  the same can be said of Michigan Tech, which was very thin at the blue line last season.</p>
<p>Finally, Alaska-Anchorage will again struggle to fight its way out of the basement as there are holes all over the ice for them this year.</p>
<p>Well, there you have it folks.  The west will (likely) be won this year by North Dakota.  I think this conference can legitimately send several teams to the NCAAs that will contend for a title.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the WUYS staff picks the WCHA this year:</p>
<p>CI &#8211; North Dakota&#8230;they have too many weapons</p>
<p>Pants &#8211; North Dakota&#8230;&#8221; I don&#8217;t know enough to argue with those numbers.  That&#8217;s some seriously heavy favoritism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chuck &#8211; Chuck, Chuck are you there?</p>
<p>DawnCherrie &#8211; TBD</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Next time we&#8217;ll have a look at the CCHA.  Until next time.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><em>From Chuck<br />
<span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;">Hey all.  I&#8217;m here!  So I&#8217;m going to have to go with CI and Pants on this one.  I pick the Fighting Sioux of </span><span style="font-style:normal;">North Dakota <span style="font-weight:normal;">to win the WCHA.  They are stacked like Jenga.</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<em><strong>Ed&#8217;s Note: </strong>Apparently DawnCherrie is picking Wisconsin to win this conference.  I know that Badger looks cute in the photo, but I don&#8217;t think the fellas on the ice will have it this year.<br />
