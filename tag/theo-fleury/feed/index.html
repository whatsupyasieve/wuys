<p>What&#8217;s that you say? What do those things have to do with hockey? If you&#8217;re Theo Fleury and Todd Warriner you get dressed up as John Travolta in tight white pants and hot purple sparkles and skate to &#8220;Saturday Night Fever&#8221; and die a slow sad death. If you&#8217;re Todd, you cross dress you&#8217;re way almost out of the competition skating to &#8220;Brick House&#8221; if Theo hadn&#8217;t almost dropped his partner on her head!</p>

<p>This week&#8217;s theme was &#8220;From screen to stage&#8221; &#8230; ahhh. It was more like theme songs from Disaster Movies. I also keep waiting for Kurt Browning and Ron Maclean to start making out at the beginning of each program. They stare into each others eyes so deeply it&#8217;s startling. It would also be highly entertaining. More so than some of the skating!</p>
<p>But on to what is REALLY important &#8211; How did Val skate? AWESOME &#8211; what else would you expect? He pulled another hat trick this week scoring two sixes from the judges! He skated to &#8220;From Russia with Love&#8221;. I&#8217;ve provided the video below because really, words simply don&#8217;t do his performance justice. ICE ICE BABY!</p>

Good God! They had the highest score Sunday from the judges. Luckily, the judges have the final say in the skate off and I don&#8217;t think they will let them go&#8230;tonight.</p>
<p>I was going to save this rant for another time, but here it goes. The NHL has allowed their players to play in the Olympics including this past year because CANADA hosted them. NOW &#8211; when RUSSIA is going to host the next Olympics, they are going to possibly revoke NHL players from participating thus that would crush Ovi&#8217;s possibility of winning gold in 2014 &#8211; quite a snub. Even though Ovi has said that no matter what the NHL decides, he is playing in Socchi in 2014. And props to Sidney in supporting Ovi&#8217;s desire.</p>
<p>I rant to Mr. Cherrie about my Hockey Husband Don&#8217;s comments ALL THE TIME that not only Russian hockey players but eastern European players have to play at a level greater than any Canadian hockey player to even be considered to compete on the ice. Yes, Canada you gave us hockey but don&#8217;t whine when someone else can do it better. Step up your game and be glad people love it!</p>
<p>But thank goodness! ValKat escaped the penalty box and even the judges said they shouldn&#8217;t have been in the bottom two. He will live again to ice dance into my heart for next week&#8217;s theme of  .. wait for it &#8230; &#8220;BRINGING SEXY BACK&#8221; oh yeah!</p>

I would predict that they would win this because they simply blew everyone else way with technique. chemistry and movement, but there is no way in h-e-double hockey sticks that Canada is going to let a Russian couple walk away with the title for their highest rated show. And since the couples are voted on by both the judges and the audience, it will be a Canadian couple that wins &#8211; Sorry Valerie but you are a hottie-boom-ba-lottie! You can ice dance with me any time!</div>

	</a><p class="wp-caption-text">he dances like the wind</p></div><strong>2. </strong>The Canadians have engineered some kind of Austin Powers figure skating fembot because these chicks either have some kind of death wish, are on death row and being forced to participate or have already been dropped on their heads so many times they don&#8217;t know any better because there is no way in hell I would let any of these guys touch me let alone throw me in the air or twirl me like a swizzle stick in a cocktail &#8211; many of which I am sure they are still throwing back! (OK &#8211; except for Valerie &#8230; move over Ovi &#8230;. yes, I just said that!)</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Theo Fleury is the Mickey Rourke of Ice Dancing with his guyliner and black fingernail polish. I can&#8217;t believe I just wrote that but I did. And you know what, he looked kind of hot and he skated well. His program wasn&#8217;t as hard as some of the others but his presentation was great.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_560" style="width: 163px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/197theo-thumb-197xauto-427261.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-560" title="197theo-thumb-197xauto-42726[1]" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/197theo-thumb-197xauto-427261.jpg?w=153" alt="" width="153" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">no guyliner here ... </p></div><strong>4. </strong>Georges Laraques did an awesome job and is my sentimental favorite for pure heart, lovability and the fact that JR said he had the biggest a** on figure skates!</p>
<p><div id="attachment_561" style="width: 220px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/georges_laraque1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-561" title="georges_laraque[1]" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/georges_laraque1.jpg?w=210" alt="" width="210" height="300" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/georges_laraque1.jpg 280w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/georges_laraque1-210x300.jpg 210w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">yoga butt is good!</p></div><strong>5. </strong>Which brings me to JR, you just never know what is going to come out of his mouth from out right flirting with the figure skaters &#8211; particularly the Russian cutie to telling everyone oh, wait that&#8217;s #6.</p>
<p><strong>6. </strong>When they started to announce the guest the judge, Mr. Cherrie started to go into apoplectic shock and I knew what was coming because there is only one man who can cause that kind of anger in Mr. Cherrie. I had to put a pillow over his head and sit on him but that didn&#8217;t stop the hockey Tourette&#8217;s that spewed forth about how Brett Hull cheated to win the Stanley Cup for the next hour and half. JR announced to everyone that after his wife had met Brett Hull she was so smitten with him she made him name their son after him. Really? OK, I may have to take back everything I said about JR in my last post. Being sensitive is one thing, being PW&#8217;d is another and then admitting it on national TV is just plain well, I am so tragically devastated I can&#8217;t even go there. Or maybe they have an open marriage and their son really is Brett Hull&#8217;s.</p>
<p><strong>7. </strong>Next week I predict a caribou or musk ox as the guest judge. It&#8217;s Canada &#8230; They gave us BOTB! Why not?</p>
