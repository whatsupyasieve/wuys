				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>3 years ago, the hockey world lost a legend.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Falla</strong> wasn&#8217;t just a great writer.</p>
<p>He was a father.  A grandfather.   A husband.  A teacher.  A friend.</p>
<p>He was an inspiration to many sports and hockey journalists (<a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2011/01/05/home-ice-open-ice/">including me!</a>), so it is today that we remember his life, his talent, and his humor.</p>
<p>Check out his books, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Home-Ice-Reflections-Backyard-Frozen/dp/1930845049">&#8220;Home Ice&#8221;</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470153059/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=486539851&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=1930845049&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=14WK8ZCFN76JH4M0MDNT">&#8220;Open Ice&#8221;</a>.  They are ones that every true hockey fan should read.</p>
<p>I was <strong>extremely lucky</strong> to have been a student of Jack&#8217;s while a journalism major at Boston University.  He taught me so much about writing that I am forever grateful.</p>
<p>So, thanks Jack.</p>
<p>We miss you.</p>
<p>One more skate around the rink, eh?</p>
