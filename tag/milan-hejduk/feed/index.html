<p>If you weren&#8217;t crying, you were the Devils.  No &#8211; they were crying too.</p>

<p>This kind of thing doesn&#8217;t just happen.  Lately more and more players are moving teams in hopes of a final dash to the little table and a reason to shake Bettman&#8217;s hand like they mean it.  2013-14 will be no different.  Here&#8217;s a look at some veteran guys trying to get their grooves back.</p>
<p><strong>Jarome Iginla &#8211; Boston Bruins</strong></p>
<p>Dust yourself off and try again.  After the trade deadline excitement that sent Iginla to the <del>Bruins</del> Penguins this season, he has landed on the Boston roster.  I would have loved to see him get a full season with Crosby, but the Penguins have $5 to spend and Iginla, at 36, is not a bargain bin guy.</p>

	<em>Really this time.</em></p>
<p>He&#8217;ll find a good fit with the Bs, whose team has changed quite a bit from what Iginla would&#8217;ve joined in March.  The deal is 1 year/$6 million (base salary plus incentives [<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/story/2013/07/05/sp-nhl-jarome-iginla-boston-bruins-free-agency.html">link</a>]) &#8211; a short term, high price, &#8216;show me what you&#8217;re working with&#8217; contract.  Smart move by the Bruins, good choice by Iggy.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Alfredsson &#8211; Red Wings</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re old and want to win before you die, consider the Red Wings!  That should be their slogan.  After 17-years in Ottawa, Daniel Alfredsson peaced out in one big cloud of proverbial dust.</p>

	<em>Seems legit.</em></p>
<p>Read the very funny <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/why-daniel-alfredsson-heel-turn-could-good-thing-203248765.html">Puck Daddy</a> take on his departure (Harrison blows the cover on my lobster metaphor for good measure).  Alfie got 1 year/$5.5 million, a lot like Iginla, except he&#8217;s already 40.  He basically told the Wings to meet him at the dealership with the keys to a Camaro and no jokes about a mid-life crisis.  Will it work?  Both teams finished 7th in their divisions last year with 56 points.  If we were betting our last, fixed-income retirement dollar, we&#8217;d go with the Red Wings too.</p>
<p><strong>Danny Briere &#8211; Montreal</strong></p>
<p>I just threw up in my mouth a little.  Apparently fifteen teams were interested in Briere&#8230; and he chose the Habs.  Ugh, Danny, WHY!?!  I speak French!  I can estimate distances in metric!  (No, I can&#8217;t.)  Why don&#8217;t the Capitals care about me and bring me polite, elfin forwards once in a damned while?!  All they did was big fat nothing and I&#8217;m stuck here with Mike Green&#8217;s hand tattoos and Nicklas Backstrom&#8217;s babydaddy rumors.  It&#8217;s not like we don&#8217;t go to overtime!  GAH.</p>

	<em>Old picture. Nice arms.</em></p>
<p>I admire the gutsiness of Danny&#8217;s choice.  He didn&#8217;t want to leave Philly, and he could&#8217;ve gone to the Islanders &#8211; they are $23 million <strong>UNDER</strong> the cap [<a href="http://capgeek.com/islanders/">CapGeek.com</a>] and after the DiPietro debacle, they&#8217;d hardly be fazed if a washed-up old guy fails to hit the 20 goal mark.  Instead, Montreal is an impossibly tough media market.  A veteran player coming off an underperforming season and a compliance buyout could be made to suffer &#8211; and already has.  Google it, you&#8217;ll see a lot of Montreal fans are more sick about this than I am.  Danny signed for 2-years, $4 mill/year.</p>

<p>Now that Danny is a Hab and I&#8217;ll have to follow them a bit, here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.habseyesontheprize.com/2013/7/8/4505682/is-the-daniel-briere-signing-as-horrible-as-we-thought">one Canadiens blogger</a> rationally considering Danny&#8217;s career, potential and role on the new team.  He writes himself into being almost excited to have Briere on board.  That&#8217;s good enough for me.  As is this hilarious <a href="http://bobgaineysstare.wordpress.com/2013/07/05/late-but-never-might-have-been-better-briere-signs-with-mtl/">blog post</a>, complete with LOTR reference.</p>
<p><strong>Milan Hejduk &#8211; Not the Avalanche</strong></p>
<p>For a second there, it was going to be &#8220;old folks dance at the family reunion&#8221; with Hejduk and Tanguay in Colorado.  Sadly, only I want that and just for Throwback Thursday&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-17058" alt="forsale" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hejduk.jpg" width="480" height="319" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hejduk.jpg 600w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hejduk-300x199.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hejduk-500x332.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></p>
<p>Word is the Avs will not resign the UFA, who has been with the organization since 1998.  Last season, the Avs gave him a 1-year, $2 million deal.  He won&#8217;t get that again.  At 37, his agent says the best look will be a contract with incentives for putting up points (these count against the cap).  That sounds reasonable to me.  With teams giving $4 million-plus, single year deals without guarantees, I imagine Hejduk will find a place that has room under their cap to spend next season.</p>
<p><strong>Jaromir Jagr &#8211; Who wants him?</strong></p>
<p>One of many changes so far this off-season, the Bruins will not renew their lease on Jagr.  He made $4.55 million on last year&#8217;s contract with Dallas/Boston.  His agent says several teams are interested in signing the 41-year old [<a href="http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=677049&amp;navid=nhl:topheads">link</a>].  Any guesses?  He&#8217;s still got it &#8211;  9 P in 11 reg season games, 10 A in 22 playoff games &#8211; but not to the tune of $4+ million.</p>
