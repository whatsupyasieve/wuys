				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I simply have to vent this and get it off my, ah, proverbial chest ladies. As the resident Ovi fan and Captials fan, I know this will come as shock, but I AM SO MAD AT HIM, at them, at the WORLD and have been for some time and I just have to say and get it out.</p>
<p>An open letter to Mr. Leonsis,</p>
<p>I say this with as a fan of Alexander Ovechkin, first and foremost, and then of hockey.  <strong>When you fired Bruce Boudreau, a little piece of me died</strong> because no matter how the mainstream media spun it, we all know that it was because of player issues – e.g. Ovechkin.</p>
<p>Boudreau is a great coach. He will probably be the best coach you will ever have. He was not the problem. We all know “What the problem is with the Washington Capitals.” The real question is what is going to be done about it?</p>
<p>For five years I’ve watched Ovechkin go from a great player to a player with a great attitude. It pains me to say that but having been an athlete myself on a team, and a captain as well; you have to lead by example.  </p>
<p>I had hoped Mr. Leonsis would have bucked the system and shook things up by NOT firing Boudreau, showing some loyalty, having some balls, and fixing the real problem. If he had, his team may have actually had a shot at the play-offs. <strong>Sometimes the Alpha dog needs a good swat to the nutsack to get back in line and lead the pack.</strong></p>
<p>But as it stands, the fans have watched Boudreau excel in Anaheim, their beloved team implode under the tutelage of Dale Hunter’s mess and Ovi still stands around on defense, stands around on offense, waits for his teammates to pass the puck to him and still misses it when they do. His attitude that he has to do it all has got to stop because guess what? He can’t, he certainly doesn’t and there are guys out there who can and are doing it better now.</p>
<p>He still has time on his contract where he can be traded. Perhaps before you fired Boudreau you should have used that bargaining chip to get your Alpha dog back in line. <strong>Now he’s the Rick Nash of the East Coast.</strong> No one will want that bad golden apple, no matter how good it might taste. <strong>He’s still too costly, you don’t know how he’ll perform and there still might be a worm in there somewhere. </strong>It&#8217;s not an imponderable conundrum. It&#8217;s just a conundrum.</p>
<p><strong>FIX IT. PLEASE.</strong></p>
<p> Missing BB,</p>
<p><strong>DC</strong></p>
