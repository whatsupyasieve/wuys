				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About a month ago, I posted my thoughts about the newest Boston Bruin, Nathan Horton.</p>
<blockquote><p>Bruins have been dying for a finisher ever since Phil Kessel left and me thinks that this Horton guy and his nasty wrist shot might be it.  Granted this all remains to be seen, I mean there is a whole season to play, but the prospect has me all googily-eyed and optimistic.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, two games into the season, folks and it is official&#8230;</p>
<p>I am googily.</p>
<p>Horton is off to a very promising start for the Bs, netting 3 goals and 1 assist in the two games that the team played vs. the Coyotes in Prague over the weekend.  He scored the only goals for the Bruins in the 1st game, where they got embarrassed by Coyotes goaltender Ilya Nikolayevich Bryzgalov, who was phenomenal.</p>
<p>Horton scored two goals from pretty much the same spot on the ice (top of the slot).  His wrist shot is ridonkulous and his release is so quick.  It was like the puck got to him and half a second later, the goal judge is lighting the lamp.  Huh?  Wait, what just happened? Thank god for the replay or I wouldn&#8217;t have ever seen the puck actually go into the net.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/tKVf0mwXpIk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>So I know that it is super early in the season, but I&#8217;m going to channel my inner Chris Berman Swammy and make a prediction:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>Nathan Horton will score 35 goals this year.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">There.  I said it.  Sure it may be bold but like the Black Eyed Peas said, &#8220;I got a feeling&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<hr />Speaking of Bryzgalov, aka Bryz &#8211;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) this dude is a #1 freak of the goalie variety</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s 6&#8217;3&#8243; and weights 200lbs, which if you don&#8217;t know, is like GIGANTIC for a netminder.  There is barely any net to shoot on when you have someone that large in the net, especially when he gets down into the butterfly position.   Shooters have to have a crazy Superman vision to pick out the infinitesimal amount of net that they can actually shoot at.</p>
<p>2) this dude has questionable taste in shirts</p>
