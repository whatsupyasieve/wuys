				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have no words (OK &#8211; yes I do) other than &#8211; I totally wish I was THAT piece of ice at THAT moment in time: Preview from San Jose &#8211; It made no difference that they lost. <strong>Ovi scored for ME and that is all that mattered.</strong> I was in HEAVEN. Time went by way too fast as I&#8217;m sure we all know when we are actually AT a game seeing our favorite team play. It just makes us appreciate them all the more. They have mad skills. It&#8217;s an amazing game. This is MY PHOTO from Pants and I watching warm ups. <strong>No, I didn&#8217;t get any grief in San Jose and yes, I wore THAT outfit.</strong> People always think I will. Even when Mr. Cherrie and I went to the 2010 Olympics, he didn&#8217;t want me wearing my Ovechkin Jersey into the hotbed of Canadian hockey fervor for fear he would have to defend my honor (and my mouth &#8211; :0).<strong> But Ovechkin commands MAD RESPECT in the NHL and even when we were in Canada.  </strong>We got some grief but it was pretty good-natured before the game but by the time Russia had lost to Slovakia, the Canadians were too drunk from their win over Switzerland to bother us! So we escaped back to the US! No harm, no foul.</p>
