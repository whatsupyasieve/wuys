<p>Those words will live with me for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>For the first time since 1972, the Black and Gold have won the most beauteous and shiniest of all trophies in professional sports.  The Bruins defeated the Vancouver Canucks, a team which lead the regular season in points, were a #1 seed and stacked with undoubtedly offensive talent like the Sedin twins and Ryan Kesler.</p>

<p>But when it comes to winning the Stanley Cup, stuff like that don&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>What matters is Heart.  Soul.  Grit.  Grime.  Desire.</p>
<p>A desire that is a slowly burning fire in the hearts of each and every one of these players since they were old enough to skate.</p>
<p>For the Boston Bruins, that fire started in Prague at the beginning of the season.</p>
<p>It smoldered throughout the months, through each long road trip, overtime win,  and shoot out loss.</p>
<p>The sparks started to pop and crackle during the first round of the playoffs versus the Canadians.</p>
<p>The fire began to grow with the sweep of the Flyers  and the emotional victory over the Lightning in the Eastern Conference Finals.</p>
<p>When the Stanley Cup Finals began, that fire was burning bright and hot, but it IGNITED because of one hit.</p>
<p>Aaron Rome&#8217;s crushing hit on <a title="Horton Hears…a Who’s That Guy?" href="http://whatsupyasieve.wordpress.com/2010/09/16/horton-hears-a-whos-that-guy/">Nathan Horton</a> in Game 3 was akin to pouring a can of lighter fluid on a campfire.</p>
<p>Once minute you&#8217;re slowing roasting marshmallows and the next, you are plucking blackened, charred, nobs of sugary goo off your sharpened branch.</p>
<p>That hit changed something in the Bruins.  It made them angry.  Vancouver&#8217;s post game jawing and comments to the press only fueled the fire more.</p>
<p>All season, the Bs played better when they were down, when people counted them out.  They crushed the Canucks in games 3, 4, and 6, and games 1, 2, and 5 were only one goal losses.</p>
<p>The Finals gave the decided advantage to the home team, but the Bruins were a team that would not be denied.</p>
<p>With the exception of a couple of minor penalties and sloppy turnovers, the Bruins played a perfect Game 7.  It was controlled yet intense.  All four of the Bruins lines were churning and working hard to shut down the Canucks, as they&#8217;d done the whole series.</p>
<p><a title="Foxy Friday – Tim Thomas" href="http://whatsupyasieve.wordpress.com/2010/11/26/foxy-friday-tim-thomas/">Tim Thomas</a> cemented his legacy in the pantheon of Boston sports and became the oldest player ever to win the Conn Smythe as the playoff MVP.</p>

<p>The Bruins defense, led by Zdeno Chara and the exceedingly underrated Dennis Seidenberg, created ghosts of the Sedins and the rest of the Canucks forwards.</p>

<p>A slurpee sounds pretty good right about now.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love wine.  I also love hockey. Now normally one does not associate the refinement and elegance of sipping a fine Napa Cabernet Sauvignon or a crisp Pinot Gris with the rough and gritty sport of hockey.  Hockey is more a beer sport, fueled by the grease of chicken wings, hard-boiled eggs behind the bar and gallons of Molson Canadian.</p>
<p>It seems like the sophisticated air of the oenological world would not mesh well with the philistine-like culture of hockey, but I think this is changing.  Here are just a few examples&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Boston Bruin Mark Recchi has a 1,000 bottle wine cellar.  Mario Lemieux got him started and a Montreal Canadians trainer got him hooked even more, wooing him with fancy wine and cheese parties.</li>
<li>A picture of David Krejci is the label for Italian winery Vignamaggio’s new Chianti Classico</li>
<li>The <a title="NHL Wine" href="http://www.alumniwineseries.com/" target="_blank">NHL Alumni Association</a> has a whole Signature Wine Series feature bottles with NHL greats like Pat Lafontaine, Bobby Hull, Gordie Hull, Bobby Clark and others on the label.</li>
<li>The “Great One”, Wayne Gretzky, has his <a title="Gretz loves grapes!" href="http://www.gretzkyestateswines.com/" target="_blank">own winery in Ontario</a> and has been making wine since 2007.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, my Little Brother (aka LB) happens to work at a very nice Napa Valley winery where he has tasted with players and owners from the Blackhawks and Sharks and NHL legends like Ray Bourque, who reportedly purchased quite a bit of wine for his <a href="http://www.trescanorthend.com/about.htm" target="_blank">Boston restaurant </a>from said vineyard.</p>
<p>Even the Winter Classic is getting in on the action.  <a href="http://www.duckhorn.com" target="_blank">Duckhorn Vineyards </a>has produced 500 cases (6000 bottles) of its delicious Napa Valley Decoy Merlot in honor of 2011 Winter Classic. This is what Pants and Dawn will be drinking while watching the game on 1/1/11.  Ladies, I have had the Decoy Merlot and it is DELISH!  I bet it will taste even better when sipped out of these…</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/dawn-wine-glass.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1715" title="dawn wine glass" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/dawn-wine-glass.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/dawn-wine-glass.jpg 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/dawn-wine-glass-150x150.jpg 150w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/dawn-wine-glass-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a> <img class="size-medium wp-image-1716" title="pants wine glass" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/pants-wine-glass.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/pants-wine-glass.jpg 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/pants-wine-glass-150x150.jpg 150w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/pants-wine-glass-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Do I ever think that hockey and the NHL will let go of its “beer-and-pizza” image?  No, and I’m totes okay with that.  I love beer and pizza.  But I am hopeful that more and more hockey fans will venture into the world of wine and start to appreciate what all those French and Italian dudes have for hundreds of years.  Trust me folks, wine (and quality wine at that) is worth tasting and enjoying.  And if I can’t convince you, maybe he can…</p>
