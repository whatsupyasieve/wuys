As I write this at the end of the first period, Mike Green stops a hard straight on goal shot from Orpik, drops like a sack of potatoes in a pool of blood. He did skate off under his own power but went straight to the locker room. He is OK. Evidently his head is made of titanium because watch the link. It was a whopper of a shot but our boy Mikey takes it like a Timex!</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/FuKe9M1RX24?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>On the Washington Caps website they interview him for a nano-second (not worth posting) although you can go there and look yourself because it&#8217;s sort of worth seeing him because he looks quite dapper. <strong>He obviously had lots of time to get dressed in a smoking hot grey suit, black shirt and do his awesome HAIR!</strong> Totes serious about all that! Either he hired a stylist or he&#8217;s been reading GQ lately because this is a NEW MIKEY. Very metro-sexual. The kind you could totally bring home to mama and your BFF gay friend would completely be slap-fighting you over.</p>
