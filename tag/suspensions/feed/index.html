				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Looks like Matt Cooke definitely WON&#8217;T be getting the Lady Byng Trophy this year&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Cooke has been suspended</strong> for the remainder of the regular season and for the 1st round of the playoffs for <a href="http://nhl.cdn.neulion.net/u/videocenter/flex/images/evp.swf">elbowing NYR defenseman Ryan McDonagh in the head</a> in yesterday&#8217;s game.</p>

<p>Not only does he let down his team, he&#8217;ll also lose $219,512.20 in salary (which all goes to the Players&#8217; Emergency Assistance Fund).</p>
<p>From <strong>Mr. Colin Campbell</strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Cooke, a repeat offender, directly and unnecessarily targeted the head of an opponent who was in an unsuspecting and vulnerable position.  This isn&#8217;t the first time this season that we have had to address dangerous behavior on the ice by Mr. Cooke, and his conduct requires an appropriately harsh response.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even the  <strong>Pens&#8217; GM, Ray Shero</strong>, agreed with the NHL&#8217;s decision.</p>
<blockquote><p>The suspension is warranted because that&#8217;s exactly the kind of hit we&#8217;re trying to get out of the game. Head shots have no place in hockey. We&#8217;ve told Matt in no uncertain terms that this kind of action on the ice is unacceptable and cannot happen. Head shots must be dealt with severely, and the Pittsburgh Penguins support the NHL in sending this very strong message.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Kudos to Campbell and Shero taking a stand!</strong></p>
<p>Matt Cooke has demonstrated time and time again what a malicious player he really is.  This makes me sad and angry.  His actions hurt not only the players he targets, but also his teammates, his coaches, and the fans of hockey.  Way to go, genius.</p>
<p>Perhaps I&#8217;m biased because Cooke took out my favorite Bruin for the season (and perhaps his career), but I don&#8217;t think that I&#8217;m alone in this.  I don&#8217;t think that <em><strong>any </strong></em>self-respecting Pens fan could honestly and in good conscious support Cooke&#8217;s actions on the ice or disagree with the NHL&#8217;s ruling.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think?  Think this suspension is too little?  Or too much? Or just enough?</strong></p>
