				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fist off, I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m writing about the Penguins. Secondly, yes, this is a few days late but between an emergency vet visit on Christmas Day, (Moe ate curling ribbon &#8211; still waiting for it to come out the other end &#8211; oh joy!) the food coma I&#8217;ve been in and the pants I&#8217;m stuck in from the afore-mentioned food coma, not a pretty sight. So I&#8217;ve finally rolled off the couch and made it to the lap top. Actually, I managed to pull it over to me without disconnecting the internet. HA! Note to self, sweat pants next year- more forgiving.</p>
<p>Anyway, because I had nothing better to do, I was watching the Penguins get <strong>SPANKED</strong> by Ottawa this weekend as Pants failed to mention in her post about Sid&#8217;s horrendous stache situation. There was a glorious fight between Godard and Carkner where Godard got popped and popped<strong> HARD </strong>by Carkner several times. You couldn&#8217;t really tell until they were pulled apart like the girls from the Duran Duran video &#8220;Girls on Film&#8221; but Godard was bleeding and went to the locker room. End of story &#8211; right? NO.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/xATBwIBNw9E?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>Godard comes back and like a kid dropped on his head too many times, tried to go AGAIN with Carkner. WHY? They show Godard on the bench draining his eye. It&#8217;s swollen SHUT. He looks like a Cabbage Patch kid. It wasn&#8217;t like Carnker started the first fight. It wasn&#8217;t like Carnker was taunting him. But when Godard got back on the ice, he grabbed Carkner and wanted to dance with him again. To Carkner&#8217;s credit, he kept his gloves and stick. You could tell he kept saying he wasn&#8217;t going to go. But Godard evidently needed a hug or something. Godard got a ten minute game misconduct and sent packing.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/XiPI5rKr-B8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>The point of the post?<strong> I CAN&#8217;T WAIT TO SEE WHAT 24/7 HAS TO SAY ABOUT THIS! INQUIRING MINDS WANT TO KNOW!</strong> We many never know what Carkner was thinking but WTF &#8211; Godard &#8230;.? Tune in tomorrow because I hope Godard remembers.</p>
