				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Once upon a time there was an All-Star Weekend that reminded me how much I love hockey.  Well, that happens every year. But this weekend, like so much of this season, I didn&#8217;t actually get to watch anything. GAH! What follows is the best I was able to mash up from Twitter and my imagination&#8230; except I couldn&#8217;t make this up:</p>

<p>This is so obviously the job for me that I&#8217;m just putting it on my resume, because it makes no sense that I wasn&#8217;t the one to do it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WtU8FGza4">Here&#8217;s the red carpet video</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">And by &#8220;this&#8221;, I mean my dead body, fallen to the ground, blocking everyone&#8217;s commute into DC. Look at these guys! Look at John&#8217;s hair! My enjoyment of this photo is the way a tween feels on the day a new One Direction album drops. I don&#8217;t Snapchat, but if I did, I would express this with the &#8220;throwing up rainbows&#8221; filter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If this were <em>The Hangover</em>, Tavares would end up with the tattoo on his face. Take care of him!</p>

<p dir="ltr">Obviously the big story of the weekend was John Scott auditioning to play himself in the Disney remake of <em>Goon</em>. He not only went to Nashville, apprently against the NHL&#8217;s wishes, he owned the weekend. His kids and goals and his MVP award are all the things we love about sports. Perseverance, faith and, hey, talent (!) delivered with a smile that thanked most people and told some others to kiss his ass.</p>

	<p class="wp-caption-text">Proudest fan club.</p></div>
<p dir="ltr">The support of so many players and teams for Scott&#8217;s efforts was also spectacular. Sportsmanship, alive and well! This is what sports should teach kids: not that everybody wins, or gets a trophy for showing up, but that life can be tough &#8211; and you can be tougher.  Scott goes, for now, back to the AHL. Fate awaits. But for that moment, when someone said he couldn&#8217;t, John Scott did anyway. Bravo, sir.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In other highlights, PK Subban topped the moment he wore Intern Jeff Skinner&#8217;s jersey with a costume so perfect I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve never worn it on Halloween. (No wig required.)</p>

<p>HI GUYS! Remember me? I was wondering if after all these years you&#8217;d like to meet and go over half a season of hockey that I&#8217;ve mostly missed.

<p>So, All-Star Game?</p>
<p>Is anyone watching this? I kinda sorta almost totally forgot about it until someone mentioned John  Tavares&#8217; pants.</p>

<p>So, Crosby didn&#8217;t get invited. That&#8217;s old news. I wrote a mental blog post called &#8220;10 Things Sid Can Do Instead of the ASG&#8221;, which was quite funny.  You should read it sometime when you develop mind-reading powers.  Or tomorrow, if I get around to posting it.</p>
<p>The newer news is Ovi and Toews are hurt/sick and also suspended. The NHL sure knows how to cry when the whole class doesn&#8217;t come to their party.</p>

<p>Alas, with no drunken draft, most of the fun is gone from the weekend anyway. The NHL has realized this too late and made some replacement efforts to attract our attention:</p>
<p><strong>1) Made John Tavares captain.</strong> He probably suggested this <em>Footloose</em>-inspired sobriety nonsense, for fear a real charitable organization might think Ovi was actually poor and needed a new car. The paperwork on that tax headache!  But it does mean more camera time for Captain T and the Pleated Pants.</p>

<p><strong>4) 3-on-3 Format.</strong> I won&#8217;t pretend to have an opinion on this, as I&#8217;ve watched approximately one OT period all season, but it sounds exciting. Top players + more open ice = more goals, right? But hasn&#8217;t the All-Star Game always ended in some Hobbit score of twelveses to eleventy anyway? Maybe the &#8220;last place in the draft&#8221; prize can be repurposed to the only player who doesn&#8217;t score a hat trick on Sunday.</p>

<p><strong>5) The John Scott story.</strong> Voted into the ASG by fans, then traded and assigned to the AHL, the saga of whether or not John Scott would appear in the ASG has been ongoing news. Yesterday, Scott published<a href="http://www.theplayerstribune.com/a-guy-like-me/"> this first person account in The Player&#8217;s Tribune</a>. In it, he explains how someone from the NHL encouraged him, even now, not to attend this weekend&#8217;s events.</p>
<p>SCREW YOU, NHL. Wrong, bad, stupid, and also, WHY? John Scott may be the only player who actually cares about this game, and you think he should stay home? Do you think the fans who voted him in should not watch? Oh no, you want them. You NEED them.</p>

<p>Read the Player&#8217;s Tribune story. It will make you want to buy a John Scott jersey and stand up in your living room when he takes the ice on Sunday. I hope every player shows up wearing his name. You may not like Scott&#8217;s brand of hockey, but it is part of hockey. Scott may not be an elite player, but he is a player. Was a player? Will be an NHL player again? Who knows. But if you love the game, you have to love it&#8217;s scars.</p>
<p>So, see you guys tomorrow night on the Twitters to techno-judge the real skills at Skills Competition: hair, beard, sass? Our trifecta of All-Star Weekend talents.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So&#8230; last night the <strong>Pens&#8217; Deryk Engelland mowed down Chicago&#8217;s Marcus Kruger</strong> with a questionably high hit.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/8bDhSKpl2F0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;m going with SHANABANNED for this one.  Eggo does sort of leave his feet and he&#8217;s definitely above shoulder height.  Kruger&#8217;s head is down, but it goes down and stay down before Eggo lines him up. <strong>Engelland could  and should have avoided this hit</strong>.</p>
<p>Eggo was not penalized on the ice, so the Hawks&#8217;  John Scott put on his stripes and fought him.  And, well&#8230; according to <a href="http://www.hockeyfights.com/players/5006">HockeyFights.com</a>, <strong>Scott is undefeated</strong> in 19 regular season NHL fights over 3+ years.  He did not disappoint.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/_795jrQti6I?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>Scott received a 2 min instigating minor, a fighting major and a 10 minute misconduct.  Engelland got 5 for taking a  beating.  On the resulting Penguins power play, Chris Kunitz scored his 12th goal of the season.  It was the <strong>first of Malkin&#8217;s three helpers</strong> on the night and what a beauty.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/EaM6pPReANo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>Kruger took a few shifts after the hit, and came back out for the second period but did not play.  He will be re-evaulated today.  If the Hawks a) let him stay on the ice and b) let him come back out, I don&#8217;t see they were very worried about it in real time.  Symptoms are not always immediate, of course.  But what about the quiet room and all that?  I say Kruger should have gone right away.  Not that it bears on the penalties or possible suspensions assessed, but I thought we were being more careful that this.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think?</strong>  Disco Dan says &#8220;It was a full body check.&#8221; [<a href="http://espn.go.com/chicago/nhl/story/_/id/7374823/chicago-blackhawks-marcus-kruger-exits-game-hit-head">link</a>]  I bet Shanahan will lock him up for a game or two, but so far no word from the NHL on a visit to the Principal&#8217;s Office.</p>
<p>Udpate: Haven&#8217;t seen it officially from the Blackhawks, but Kruger is apparently concussed and out tonight:</p>
