				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who says the NHL is bias? Letting the Punching Pens off when J. Staal uses another player for a nail to hang his velvet Elvis? nah &#8230; If that were Ovi, he&#8217;d be on early vacation doing the turkey dance in his mankini! Do I need to post another picture of Ovi with out his shirt because I CAN?!</p>
<p>So this is what happens when <strong>you&#8217;re Westcoast hockey playing one of the WORST EASTCOAST teams and YET you still get it in the back end</strong> because your WESTCOAST. Read it and weep my friends but you still won&#8217;t care &#8217;cause y&#8217;all kickin&#8217; it east coast. <strong>I was watching this game going WTF!</strong> At least they ended up correcting themselves.</p>
<div id="attachment_2835" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/doughty.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2835" title="Doughty" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/doughty.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/doughty.jpg 584w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/doughty-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">being touched by god has its draw backs</p></div>
<p><a href="http://kings.nhl.com/" target="_blank">Los Angeles Kings</a> defenseman <a href="http://www.nhl.com/ice/player.htm?id=8474563">Drew Doughty</a> left Wednesday&#8217;s 3-1 win at Edmonton with a pair of assists. After further review, he wound up with a pair of goals instead. The first two of the Kings&#8217; three goals were credited to forward <a href="http://www.nhl.com/ice/player.htm?id=8460496">Ryan Smyth</a>,  a former Oilers star who&#8217;s still a crowd favorite in Edmonton. Smyth  got credit for tipping two of Doughty&#8217;s power-play shots past Edmonton  goalie <a href="http://www.nhl.com/ice/player.htm?id=8459140">Nikolai Khabibulin</a>. But Smyth said afterward he hadn&#8217;t touched either shot. The NHL reviewed  the video on Thursday and agreed, crediting Doughty with his first  multigoal game of the season.</p>
<p>Doughty had just 4 goals in his first 45 games for the Kings after  getting 16 goals and 43 assists as a Norris Trophy finalist last season.</p>
<p><strong>Does this second goal EVEN LOOK like Ryan Smyth touched it?</strong></p>
