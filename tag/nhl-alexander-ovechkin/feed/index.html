				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was educating myself on the past history of fans vs players. I am also not necessarily referring to the Vancouver incident &#8211; I don&#8217;t want anyone hurt at a game &#8211; not a fan or a player. But perhaps agro fans should stay home and work it out privately than bother the rest of us who pay good money to see our boys play. I don&#8217;t think hockey players should be subjected to belligerent fans who feel they can berate them, spit on them, pour beer on them, scream obscenities and otherwise irritate and treat the players as less than human because they paid to watch them play or because they have them as a captive audience in the penalty box. Not cool. Can&#8217;t we all just enjoy the game? I know &#8230; kumbaya.</p>
<p>And now, a therapy suggestion for those fans. And no Pants, I did not create this. I don&#8217;t have the technical capabilities to but it&#8217;s a suggestion for those who should stay home and work it out. Privately &#8211; Please. Sean Avery &#8211; that means you too! HA!</p>
