<p>Okay, so perhaps it is a bit premature to be saying that, but after what Tomas Hertl did last night, can you really blame us?</p>
<p>The San Jose Sharks rookie forward scored 4 goals (!) last night.  Each goal he scored was more impressive than the one before and his <em>piece de resistance</em> was this.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/43zjg6iQw7c?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>Salty.  Like the ocean.</p>
<p>Best thing about this goal?  You know that he&#8217;s totally been practicing that shot since he was a little kid.  He already had the hat trick going, so why not?  It&#8217;s not really like he had anything to lose at that point.   Your team is winning (in large part, thanks to you).  You&#8217;re streaking to the net alone.  You&#8217;re on a high like us after a case of Mexi-colas and Tim Horton&#8217;s Timbits.</p>
<p>If he misses, he gets made fun of mercilessly in the locker room as is want to happen when you&#8217;re a rookie.  Or he makes it and makes history.</p>
<p>The look on his face says it all.</p>

	<em>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe that ACTUALLY worked.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>He can&#8217;t stop smiling.  He won&#8217;t stop smiling.  Neither can we. [<a href="http://video.sharks.nhl.com/videocenter/console?id=455044&amp;catid=125">click here</a> for smiley, happy, good-time post game interview]</p>
<p>With his performance last night, Herlt becomes the 4th youngest player in NHL history to score 4 goals in a game and the first to do so since 1988.</p>
<p>Just so you are aware, Tomas Hertl was born in 1993.</p>
<p>You know what we were doing in 1993?</p>
<p>We were in high school.</p>
