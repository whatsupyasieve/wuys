<p>In 12 NHL playoff games, the Bruins power play has been abysmal.  Horrid.  Embarrassing.</p>
<p>2 for 41.</p>
<p>Seriously, it&#8217;s not funny. Chuck is not laughing.</p>

<p>After the Bruins dropped Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals on Saturday, I&#8217;m puzzled.  Perplexed.  Flummoxed.</p>
<p><strong>What exactly is Coach Claude was working on in practice?</strong></p>
<div style="width: 522px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://cdn2.sbnation.com/photo_images/28555/45333_Canadiens_Bruins_Hockey.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="309" /><p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;Ya, see that net there? Whatever you do, DON&#039;T go there. You hear me? Do not go to the net.&quot;</p></div>
<p>They had 8 days to work on this disastrous aspect of their game.  Surely, you&#8217;d think that they stop practicing that <strong>rush-in-the-offensive-zone-then-skid-to-a-stop-at-the-top-of-the-circle move</strong> that they love so well (I&#8217;m looking at you, Brad Marchand), and work on the power play.  By no means do I claim to be an expert in these things, but I&#8217;m pretty sure you&#8217;re supposed to score when you have an extra guy on the ice.  <strong>5 &gt; 4.</strong></p>
<p>Why are the Bruins just passing the puck back and forth on the power play?  Point-point-hash-point-hash-other hash-point.  Boring and ineffective.</p>
<p>How about getting some guys in front of the net? Plant Lucic and/or Chara in front of Roloson.  Try to see the puck with those beasts standing in front of you.  <strong>If he can&#8217;t see it, he can&#8217;t save it</strong>.  Very simple concept, no?</p>
<p><strong>Put SeguinPenguin on the PP</strong>.  Please.  Just once.  Give it a shot, Claude.  Throw caution to the wind!  Be a wild and crazy guy.</p>
<p>If it works out, you&#8217;ll be <strong>hailed as a genius and babies all over Boston will be named in your honor</strong>.  If it doesn&#8217;t, well, you can chalk it up to trying to give your team the best chance of winning.</p>
<div style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" " src="http://therattrick.com/files/2010/09/baby-in-skates1.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="458" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hockey Baby Love.</p></div>
<p>Bruins were trotting out Recchi and Ryder out there, and while they&#8217;re obviously skilled, they <strong>ain&#8217;t spring chickens</strong>.  Seguin has an excitement, a youthful exuberance, <strong>a fluffy puppy mentality</strong> that could make him dangerous with the man advantage.  He so happy to be playing in the NHL Playoffs, he&#8217;ll do what ever you want.  He&#8217;s obvious has the skill to be playing at this level (see video below), so why not give him the chance to<strong> make a little magic</strong>?</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/keScsEt5VfM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>Also, why do you<strong> sit him for 15 minutes</strong> after he scores a goal for you?  Get him out there!  Maybe he&#8217;ll score a few more for you.</p>
<p><strong>Yes, I am a Seguinista, </strong>if you haven&#8217;t noticed.</p>
<div style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://d3kds9trhs762r.cloudfront.net/files/2011/04/Tyler-Seguin-Boston-Bruins-HMA.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="423" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Admit it. Now you are too.</p></div>
<p>On the other hand, <strong>maybe it is not all that simple</strong> as we all make it out to be.  I&#8217;m not a fly on the wall of the Bruins locker room or practice rink (but what I&#8217;d give if I could), so I don&#8217;t pretend to know what conversations Claude, Cam Neely, and Peter Chiarelli have had or the inner working of a NHL club.  But <strong>without Savard (*sniff*) and Bergeron, the Bruins are lacking</strong> and they need to do something about it stat.</p>
<p>If we don&#8217;t, you can kiss a shot at the shiny silver cup buh-bye.  Stammer, Squishy, Roli, Lecavalier, and Finnish Finisher, Sean Bergenheim will snatch it right up from under you.</p>
