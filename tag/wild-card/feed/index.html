<p>Well, it&#8217;s deja vu all over again.</p>

<p>In a detailed memo sent to League teams on Tuesday, the NHL again proposed a new realignment plan.  This new plan would see the League go from six divisions to four and introduce a form of divisional playoffs instead of the current conference system.</p>
<p>Again, the plan needs approval from the NHLPA and Board of Governors.  If ratified, the plan would take effect for the 2013-14 regular season.</p>
<p>Under this new plan, the conferences would be re-aligned, albeit unevenly.  Columbus and Detroit would move into the Eastern Conference, leaving the Western Conference with only 14 teams.  Teams in the &#8220;Blue&#8221; and &#8220;Green&#8221; would be the East and &#8220;Yellow&#8221; and &#8220;Orange&#8221; would be West.</p>
<p>The schedule would see each team play teams in the other conference, both at home and away.</p>
<p>In the divisions with 7 teams (Yellow, Orange), the teams would play intraconference opponents three times per season and 5 of the 6 intradivision opponents five times a season.  The 6th opponent within the division would be played four times.</p>
<p>In the division with 8 team (Blue and Green),  teams would play intraconference three times and intradivision either four or five times per season.</p>
<p>With the obvious imbalance between the conference, the League has proposed introducing a wild-card to the Stanley Cup Playoffs.</p>
<p>I guess if it works for the NFL and MLB, it could work for hockey?</p>

<p>Under this new system, the top 3 teams in each of the four divisions would qualify for the postseason. The final four spots would go to the two teams in each conference with the next-best records. In theory, 5 teams from one division and just 3 from the other in each conference could make the post season.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t the NHL know that we don&#8217;t do no math?  This is too many numbers for us to handle.</p>
<p>Obviously, this plan is not set in stone and who&#8217;s to say that it&#8217;ll even get approved.</p>
<p>But hypothetically, if it did get approved, how would you feel about it?</p>
<p>Love? Hate? Bored Indifference?</p>
