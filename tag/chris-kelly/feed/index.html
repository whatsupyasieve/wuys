<p>I have no idea what is going on with Johnny&#8217;s shirt but honestly I really don&#8217;t care.  Because his face. And the fluffy puppy face. That dog looks as happy as I would be to have Johnny&#8217;s arm wrapped around me.</p>

<p>Things I love about this photo: Brad Marchand&#8217;s Sweater.  The dog&#8217;s name.  Great name for a dog.  If I ever get a dog, I am doing to name him Han Solo.  Or Lando Calrissian.  Either one would work.</p>

<p>Continuing with the Star Wars theme, next we have Iggy with his dog, Onja aka Yoda.  Yoda is killing it with those ears.  She might be carrying a little extra weight around the middle but let&#8217;s face it &#8211; it is friggin&#8217; cold in Calgary.</p>

<p>How cute of a pair to Kelly and Mama Celeste make?  It doesn&#8217;t even matter that she is named after a microwaveable pizza! She&#8217;s adorable.  And Kelly holding on to her so gently is just precious.  Because you know at any minute she is going to jump out his arms and go skidding across the ice on those wee tiny paws of hers.</p>

<p>I want to take Roscoe home with me right now and rename him Han Solo and love him and squeeze him and pet him.  Oh and his picture also features Milan Lucic.  Who apparently went to the James Neal School of Awkward Dog Holding.</p>

<p>So much going on with this photo.  Despite the horribly unphotogenic background, I kind love this picture. You know how they say that dogs and their owners start to resemble each other?  Ladies and Gentleman &#8211; there is your proof right there.</p>

<p>Wiggles? Bubbles Lollipop? I can&#8217;t. Seriously, Wiggles.  He (she?) is werking it.  Smizing.  Fierce. Because I can&#8217;t for the life of me imagine Dennis &#8220;Der Hammer&#8221; Seidenberg actually naming his dogs this, so I&#8217;m going to assume that his children named them.  Or perhaps there is a softer, gentler side of Seids we don&#8217;t yet know about.</p>

<p>That sound you hear is my roommate <a href="http://www.twitter.com/sailingfoodie">@sailingfoodie</a> collapsing on the floor and dying.  She is OBSESSED with bulldogs and spends hours creating a plan on how she would get her hypothetical dog up to our 3rd floor apartment.  (We were going to rig a rope &amp; pulley system from our living room window and pull the dog up in a bucket, in case you were wondering.)</p>
<p>While Zorro&#8217;s cuteness is undeniable, the real winner in this photo is Gregory Campbell.  He&#8217;s one of the<a title="Foxy Friday: Gregory Campbell" href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/2012/03/09/foxy-friday-gregory-campbell/"> foxier Bruins</a> and after that <a title="Foxy Friday: Gregory Campbell – The Sequel" href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/2013/06/07/foxy-friday-gregory-campbell-the-sequel/">whole playing-on-a-broken-leg thing</a>, he&#8217;s an out-right legend.</p>

<p>Of course they take the photo in front of the Bunker Hill Monument.  Because if there was anyone who would be from Charlestown, it would be Shawn Thornton.  You&#8217;ve seen The Town, right?  You can&#8217;t tell me that he wouldn&#8217;t have fit in perfectly as a bank-robbing extra.  Clearly, the greyhound must be his wife&#8217;s and the other is his.  Because there is no way that a <a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/2012/01/11/shawn-thornton-for-president/">guy like that</a> has a little dog.</p>

<p>WEE LITTLE PUPPY!  TUUUUUUKKKKKKAAAA!  If he&#8217;d have put that hot dog dog actually in his goalie mitt, there would have been a nuclear cute-splosion and I would be writing this post from some desolate radioactive wasteland. Also, did you see the dog&#8217;s name?  Wishful thinking, little buddy, but I applaud your ambition.</p>

<p>Lola is adorable but there is just not enough juxtaposition in this photo.  Chara needs a smaller dog &#8211; like a Pomeranian.  Or a Maltese.  Can you imagine?  Just look at Chara.  He can&#8217;t even fit in the seats.  Sort of like me at a Red Sox game. #tallpeopleproblems</p>
<p>Not to be out done, even the Bruins management and coaching staff got in on the fun.</p>

<p>Bosco looks like a dog that Neely would have.  Big. Strong. Devastatingly handsome.</p>
<p>Peter Chiarelli and his pugs!  Butterballers!</p>
<p>Sadly no Patrice Bergeron, but I&#8217;m sort of glad for that.  Because if there was a photo of Patrice, wearing a sweater, holding a puppy&#8230;I&#8217;m not sure that I could have handled it.</p>

<p>Granted it was against the Carolina Hurricanes, who are taking a long ride on the struggle bus, but the effort was the Bruins&#8217; most consistent of the season and they were rewarded with a 4-1 victory on the road.  Bruins were 0-3 on the road after starting the season 4-0.</p>
<p>Bruins forwards were working hard, creating opportunities, and running the Canes&#8217; defense around. Two of the four Bruins goals came from defensemen, including Johnny Boychuk&#8217;s rocket, his first goal in 3, 586 games.  Okay, so not THAT many games but it has been a while since JB55 put on past the goalie.</p>

<p>Especially positive was the play of Soderberg/Kelly/Smith line.   Soderberg and Smith each had a goal and an assist.  This line seems to be finding some mojo as evidence by their nifty, quick passing in the offensive zone and it looks like Soderberg&#8217;s looooong road to the NHL might have been worth the journey.</p>
<p>Originally drafted by the Blues in the 2004 Entry Draft, this season will be the first full season for the 28-year-old Swede.  He&#8217;s got 8 points in 14 games and did we mention that he&#8217;s Swedish?</p>

<p>Marchand started on the 3rd line but by late in the 2nd period was taking shifts on the 4th line. Since the summer and his break-up with Seguin, he just hasn&#8217;t been quite the player that we expected.  Perhaps he spend too much time downing pints of ice cream, while listening to Sade and looking at photos of his lost love on his iPhone.</p>
<div style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="" src="http://31.media.tumblr.com/e3517bf51e8c6dc05d84bf0ba334f6c0/tumblr_mv3jeemZ971qci7aeo2_250.gif" width="250" height="214" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Sad Marchand.</p></div>
<p>After the game, Bruins had to jump on a plane to NYC where they&#8217;ll take on the Rangers tonight.  If I had to wager a guess, I think that Caron will be back in the line up, along with Thornton, with Marchy taking in the game from the press box.</p>
<p>Wonder if the popcorn at MSG is any good&#8230;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey all&#8230;</p>
<p>Chuck here.  Sorry I&#8217;ve been MIA lately.  Between grad school, Thanksgiving, and my grandpa dying, it&#8217;s been a little crazy town over here.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m BACK!  So here it goes&#8230;</p>
<hr />
<p>He&#8217;s might not be fancy or flashy or a household name.</p>
<p>But one thing <strong>Chris Kelly is &#8211; A damn good hockey player</strong>.</p>
<div style="width: 391px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lvarvizFzW1qlq5l2o1_400.jpg" alt="" width="381" height="468" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Like a ninja.</p></div>
<p>Picked up last season from Ottawa a few weeks before the trade deadline, CK23 is primarily seen as a defensive centerman.  But this year, he has been quietly and effectively displaying his offensive prowess for the resurgent Boston Bruins.</p>
<p>His stats so far this season &#8211; 9 goals &amp; 7 assists  and a +15 through 22 games.  Not so bad for a 3rd line center, eh?</p>
<p>Kelly came up seriously big in the Bs win over the Jets on Saturday, scoring the <strong>game-tying AND the game-winning goals.  </strong>That first star was rightly deserved.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/CPgYpyqIuLE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p><strong>He&#8217;s a player of great skill, serious consistency, and hard work.</strong>  Day in and day out you know what you are going to get from Kelly, which makes him in valuable role model for young players like Seguin and Marchand.   Much like Patrice &#8220;The Professor&#8221; Bergeron, he does so many little things that make him an invaluable addition to any team.</p>
<p>With Rich Peverley and Beniot Pouliot on the wings and Kelly in the center, the <strong>Bruins&#8217; 3rd line production has been better than I think anyone could have expected</strong>.  Peverley is 4-10-14 with +7 rating.  Even Pouliot&#8217;s play has been good considering his &#8220;reputation&#8221;. Maybe that has something to do with the calm, quiet leadership that Kelly provides.</p>
<p>His demeanor and work ethic have not gone unnoticed by Coach Claude either.  Kelly has been sharing the &#8220;A&#8221; with Andrew Ference this season (Kelly wears it on the road, Ference at home), which goes to show that some times <strong>nice guys do finish first</strong>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night&#8217;s game between the Bruins and the Hurricanes was pretty good&#8230;.</p>
<p>until this happened.</p>

<p><strong>PARTY IN THE PENALTY BOX!</strong></p>
<p>But this is a party you wouldn&#8217;t really want to go to.  The food is bad.  The champagne is flat.  And someone clogged up the toilet.</p>
<p><strong>It was ugly, people.  Oooglay.</strong></p>
<p>And like Nine Inch Nails, we were headed into a downward spiral.</p>
<p>Chris Kelly &#8211; perhaps the most unassuming, gentle man on the Bruins &#8211; even got into a fight.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS KELLY!</strong></p>
