				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MAYDAY! MAYDAY!</p>
<p>Help!</p>
<p>The<strong> Bruins are teetering precariously on the edge</strong> of the abyss&#8230;and they are threathening to take me with them.</p>
<p>Saturday, they lost to the Capitals.  Yesterday, they got violated by the Penguins.  <strong>Patrice Bergeron and Adam McQuaid both got injured</strong>.  With Nathan Horton, Rich Peverley, Beniot Pouliot, and Tuukka Rask already out, it only to the dire situation the Black and Gold find themselves in late in the season.</p>
<p><strong>Can I get a prayer circle?</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_9601" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/bergeron-patrice-sad-face.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9601 " title="Bergeron, Patrice - sad face" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/bergeron-patrice-sad-face.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="312" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/bergeron-patrice-sad-face.jpg 493w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/bergeron-patrice-sad-face-300x191.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Never have I seen a sadder face. Never.</p></div>
<p>McQuaid took a hard hit from James Neal in the 1st and did not return for rest of the game.  Bergeron took a shot off the leg and labored badly to try to battle through, but did not return.</p>
<p>Obviously, <strong>goaltending is a SERIOUS issue</strong> for the Bruins.  Serio, people.  I knew losing Tuukka would be tough but I had not fully realize it until this weekend.</p>
<p>And when I did, <strong>this was me.</strong></p>

<p>Luckily I managed to pull myself together and attempted to analyze this mess of a situation the Bruins are in.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, Tukkaa would have played Saturday&#8217;s matinee versus the Caps, allowing Thomas to rest up for the game against the Pens.  But with Rask recovering from a groin injury, the <strong>Bruins were up Crap Creek without a paddle.  </strong></p>
<p>Hell, they didn&#8217;t even have a boat.</p>
<p>Then you add in the clocks springing forward for daylight savings, and  you have a <strong>recipe for a grade A+, #1 disaster of epic proportion</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Yesterday&#8217;s game was that unmitigated disaster.</strong></p>
<p>The Pens jumped all over Thomas from the first whistle scoring 3 goals in the first.  It was ooglay.</p>
<p>I was <strong>ready to rage every time the Penguins touched the puck</strong> out of sheer frustration.</p>

<p>Normally, I have no issues with the Penguins.  While they are not my favorite team, I respect them and like alot of their players but yesterday, <strong>I want to kick all of them in the shins.</strong></p>
<p>Like really hard.</p>
<p>Bruins managed to stauch the bleeding somewhat at the beginning of the 2nd period by pulling Thomas and putting in Marty Turco.  TURCO TIME, YA&#8217;LL!</p>
<p>Turco played well in his first NHL game in over a year and <a href="http://www.nesn.com/2012/03/marty-turco-admits-austrian-fans-threw-dead-fish-at-him-during-his-ec-red-bull-salzburg-days.html">no one threw smelly fish at him</a>.  He only allowed 2 goals (if that can be considered a postitive) and made some great saves, including this gem on JStaal.</p>
<!--YouTube Error: bad URL entered-->
<p><strong>Poke Check.  Stack the pads.</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how it could get any worse for the Bruins but if they hope to have any chance to make a run for defending their Stanley Cup, they need to do something.</p>
<p>I have a suggestion.</p>
<p><strong>Bubble wrap.</strong></p>
<p>And lots of it.</p>
<p>Call Mike Green.  I&#8217;m sure he has some extra lying about.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok, was anyone watching the Chicago Blackhawks and the Philadelphia Fliers last Sunday? <strong>Because this is a priceless little nugget of gold.</strong> Not because it was a rematch between the Stanley Cup teams of last year but because Marty Turco mocked Pierre Mcguire on national TV &#8211; NBC to be exact. Mike Milbury plows over him between periods when NBC has hockey games and everyone else talks over him. He&#8217;s the kid no one liked but kept showing up to play and always thought he should be captain. <strong>Someone even refered to his Stanley Cup Ring as his &#8216;decoder ring&#8217; </strong>which prompted me to ask Mr. Cherrie &#8220;He played hockey? He has a ring?&#8221; Mr. Cherrie shrugged and pulled up the internet and did some research. He won them as a &#8216;scout&#8217; and assistant coach with the Pittsburgh Penguins. <strong>That&#8217;s like getting &#8216;most improved&#8217; by proxy which explains why he wears them all the time.</strong></p>
