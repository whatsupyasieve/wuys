				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Blackhawks&#8217; game seven, 2-1 OT loss to the Canucks last night was absolutely heartbreaking.  <strong>It was also an incredible hockey game</strong>.</p>
<p>Alex Burrows scored just 2:43 in, and that goal would stand for almost the entire night.  Every Canuck player seemed 10 feet tall at times &#8211; the Hawks couldn&#8217;t go through or around them, and they were getting hit from all sides.  Vancouver had 3 shots on a penalty kill while the Hawks had none with the man advantage.  But <strong>Chicago kept coming: always scrappy, always giving everything.</strong></p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/no2fDcNRWeo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>Corey Crawford was an actual miracle in net.  <strong>If you could win the Conn Smythe in a single game</strong>, Crawford and Ryan Kessler could have sawed in it half.  Game 7 was like an endless boxing match and I felt beaten.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/lj9bR8fqKRk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>With 5 minutes left in the third, the hairs on my arms were standing up.  I could feel the electric charge building and something was going to snap.  At 18:04,<strong>shorthanded, on a second attempt nearly laying on the ice</strong>, Jonathan Toews scored the tying goal.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/KgxVPoJYFeA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>This actually makes me cry.  He willed this to happen &#8211; with all of our help this puck went in the net by sheer force of will.  <strong>Jonathan Toews has the heart of a lion and I will fight anyone who questions his place as captain</strong>.  I could see the &#8220;History Will Be Made&#8221; commercial, taste the champagne.</p>
<p>But luck, you are a bastard.  The Hawks were lucky to make the playoffs.  They were lucky to make it to game 7 and lucky to make it to overtime.  <strong>I was hoping luck would hold out just a few more shifts</strong>.  But in maybe the perfect metaphor for their 2010-2011 season, the Blackhawks just couldn&#8217;t quite get there.</p>

<p>The had a very rough start to the year, like their 3-0 record to start this series.  In the second half, they came on huge like they did to make this series 3-3.  Right at the end of the regular season, when it was within reach, the Blackhawks couldn&#8217;t get that last game to clinch.  Someone else&#8217;s loss was their gain.  And that&#8217;s where this playoff story had a different ending.  <strong>Chicago had more guts in Game 7 than they did at any single moment all season long</strong>.  Just because it didn&#8217;t happen doesn&#8217;t mean they didn&#8217;t earn it.</p>
<p>So Chicago is out.  But after a very long season that fought back at every turn, at least <strong>they went out like Champs</strong>.</p>
