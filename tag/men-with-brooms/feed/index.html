<p>Again this week they put ValKat in the bottom two when they are by far and away the best skaters &#8211; which makes me think <strong>Canadian&#8217;s are Russian skater-haters!</strong> Seriously, I don&#8217;t think my blood pressure can take many more of these episodes. Patrice and Shae-Lynn had a far less difficult routine but scored the highest so far this season &#8211; but riddle me this Batman? ValKat have done two firsts in three routines for BOTB &#8211; double lutz and a double throw. So how can they be continuously in the bottom two? Even in this shirt smokin&#8217; hot Val does not deserve to go home and thank god &#8211; he didn&#8217;t! My life will go on! But my inner publicist says &#8211; Val &#8211; don&#8217;t let them show you having a snit. Not good PR. Next week think warm and fuzzy! Keep it hot &#8211; you know how to! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>If Canada would allow US residences to vote, I think this would have a completely different result but they won&#8217;t allow us to &#8211; which totally blows!</p>
<p>As I write this, Mr. Cherrie is watching <em>Men with Brooms</em>, another Canadian show and the vending machine is tormenting one of the characters &#8211; with a RUSSIAN ACCENT &#8211; OK &#8211; don&#8217;t make me go there &#8211; again &#8211; I will turn to Johnny Weir! While words really can&#8217;t do justice to anything Johnny-Weir-esque: He looks like a bastard child of Ziggy Stardust and something Sarah Palin shot down from a plane in Alaska and God bless him for it! Now that&#8217;s entertainment&#8230;<br />
