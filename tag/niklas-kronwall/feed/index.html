				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After seeing this clip last night I had a dream that Kris Letang shoveled me off the ice with his stick just like this. I don&#8217;t remember anything else because Poe decided to start yowelling like there was no tomorrow per his usual 4:00AM good morning Mom, I&#8217;m hungry &#8211; feed me now please. I presume it was because I was stalking I mean, we were playing a friendly game of WUYS shinny hockey because I vaguely remember wearing a jersey with those letters on it and Pants screaming with laugher that she was going to pee her pants. I don&#8217;t really ice skate well enough for this which was probably why I was escorted off the ice. Anyway, this clip was what prompted the dream.</p>
<p>Niklas Knonwall of the Detroit Red Wings shoveled his team-mate Patrick Eaves, off the ice, during a power play when they were short-handed, after he had blocked a shot and he was injured. Hilarious, yes but wow, give the guy a second, he just made a brilliant play to stop a goal and sacrificed his body. Detroit is a machine. But dude, get some feelings.</p>
