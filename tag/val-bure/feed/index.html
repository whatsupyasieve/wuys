<p>ValKat! and I&#8217;m not just sayin&#8217; it because that who is I have been championing all season! I honestly would not have called this in my wildest dreams and if you&#8217;ve been following my posts, you know THOSE ARE PRETTY DAMN WILD. <strong>HOLY SIDNEYÂ CROSBYÂ IN MARIOÂ LEMIEUX&#8217;S BASEMENT!</strong> I sat in front of the TV with my jaw on the floor speechless which is actually a very rare state to ever find me &#8211; ask Mr. Cherrie.</p>
<p>I was going to whine about how I had to suffer through two nights of TWO HOURS of BOTBÂ this week, normally I have to watch only and hour on Sunday a mercifully short half hour on Monday. But this week the one hour finale was a super painful &#8211; chock-full of all sorts of non-sense filler including an all-men&#8217;s skate of a cowboy theme about save a horse, ride a cowboy. Which well, yes, I would, in fact, like to take Val up on that. I won&#8217;t further bore you with any of that.</p>

	</a><p class="wp-caption-text">yeah ... baby!</p></div>But I will comment about the night before because the guest judge was actually someone you might know because I actually remember watching him skate back in the 1984 Olympics and he was simply adorbs last night. He was <strong>Christopher Dean</strong>, the ice dancing male partner of the famous gold medalists of Torvill and Dean who wowed the world with their amazing performance of &#8220;Bolero&#8221;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ru6qjbRghyU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>Anyway, his comments were fabulous and funny and spot on, his hair was AMAZING and after ValKatÂ skated his comment sent Sandra BezikÂ and every female in the audience and watching into a warm and giggly mass of hysteria which created a perfect storm that must have sentÂ every female in CanadaÂ to the phone and the internet to vote for Valeri &#8211; good job my man, good job! Mission accomplished. <strong>As Christopher said after ValKat skated, &#8220;Shaken, stirred and still standing!&#8221; YOW! See, I&#8217;m not the only one hot and bothered after they skate. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></p>
<p>It actually reaffirms my faith in people whoÂ if you are the best in a competition, you might actually win regardless of your nationality. So I will apologize Canada &#8211; I&#8217;m glad you saw past the pair as Russian and awarded them the trophy because they were skating for Canadian charities. They were truly on another level than any other pair out there week after week. It was a win-win all around.</p>
<p>So now my Sunday nights will be pain-free &#8211; oh yeah, until that special in December called &#8220;After the Ice&#8221; or something which will reveal secrets of this last season now that the winners have been revealed. Please, please, please for the love of God, stop beating this dead, sparkly unicorn!</p>
<p>Little pre-season interview nugget with Val that I found &#8211; God he&#8217;s adorable.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You remember in the 80&#8217;s when TV writers didn&#8217;t know how to end the big cliff hanger episode on Dallas or Moonlighting so they did the Ol&#8217; have Maddy and Bruce get together &#8211; something you&#8217;ve been waiting for, like forevs, only to be sucker punched like Avery, to find out Maddy was having a bad case of od&#8217;ingÂ on MidolÂ and it was all a PMS dream? Well welcome to this week&#8217;s episode of BOTB!</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1331" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/hookup-moonlighting1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1331" title="hookup-moonlighting[1]" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/hookup-moonlighting1.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="192" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/hookup-moonlighting1.jpg 524w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/hookup-moonlighting1-300x192.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Back when Bruce was hot.</p></div>It opened with Kurt teaching Ron how to figure skate &#8230; yes, you heard me. Talk about being a toe pick tease. Kurt even made a reference about Ron &#8216;coming out of the figure skating closet&#8217;. I&#8217;m telling you, I had my popcorn ready for a full on make out session &#8211; but no. After weeks of being teased, it STILL DIDN&#8217;T HAPPEN. You know why? Because Ron&#8217;s real life metro-sexual life partner was this week&#8217;s guest judge &#8211; MY HOCKEY HUSBAND &#8211; the great DONALD S. CHERRY &#8211; let the true goo-goo eyes begin as Ron breathlessly whispers &#8216;Grapes&#8217; and all sorts other sweet nicknames they must call each in the throesÂ of passion between HNIC commercial breaks.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1329" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/doncherryhnic200805311.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1329" title="doncherryhnic20080531[1]" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/doncherryhnic200805311.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/doncherryhnic200805311.jpg 768w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/doncherryhnic200805311-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Grapes and Ronny-Poo</p></div>But the REAL hilarity ensued with the super-sweet flashback to JR&#8217;s &#8216;childhood&#8217; when Grapes and Ronny-poo visited JR&#8217;s parents 20 years ago to watch JR play in the Stanley cup finals at their house. With JR&#8217;s adorable Dad in his red sweat pants showing Grapes JR&#8217;s various trophies. Grapes has to comment about how &#8220;That&#8217;s not a very big trophy for being the highest scorer.&#8221; Really Grapes? Is Ron&#8217;s &#8216;trophy&#8217; bigger? You realize JR was just a kid? Is that legal in Canada? You know, for an old man you only played <strong>ONE GAME IN THE NHL.</strong> He is really an ASS &#8211; you heard me. Many people do not realize this old goat only played <strong>ONE GAME IN THE NHL.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, fast forward to JR cowering in the cornerÂ  like he just had a really bad acid flash back or was banging his head against the table while that video was being shown. Not sure which or maybe it was both. May explain a little more about JR. Now mind you, this all happened before the first commercial break!</p>
<p>It was &#8220;Men&#8217;s night&#8221;. Yes, and don&#8217;t ask me to explain because I still have no real idea what that meant except that each dude had to skate for 30 seconds solo. For Ron and Grapes, I imagine that is too long for either of them at their age to sustain anything and I will just leave it at that.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1327" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/toddrotatorwk7-thumb-620xauto-599621.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1327" title="toddrotatorwk7-thumb-620xauto-59962[1]" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/toddrotatorwk7-thumb-620xauto-599621.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="170" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/toddrotatorwk7-thumb-620xauto-599621.jpg 620w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/toddrotatorwk7-thumb-620xauto-599621-300x170.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I am Man.. hear me roar.</p></div>So how was the skating? Well, Patrice the boring frenchmanÂ tripped several times and yet, the judges gave him a pass. Kelly actually manage to pull off something that resembled skating for once and instead of viagraÂ induced fist pumps, we got finger stabbing at the camera. Todd is looking more and more like CesareÂ Romero from the original BATMAN TV series and his skating was blah. Val, oh Val. He had a very small fall. Not at all as noticeable as the tripping frenchmanÂ but again, because Canadians hate Russians, he was severely punished and slammed for it. Grapes even makes a comment about not knowing that Russians could be &#8216;that good in the corners&#8217; and starts rambling on about how much better Val&#8217;s brother was than him and too bad he&#8217;s retired because Calgary could use him now. WOW! I bet the Sutter brothers are happy about that slam on national TV!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1336" style="width: 239px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/819494331.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1336" title="81949433[1]" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/819494331.jpg?w=229" alt="" width="229" height="300" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/819494331.jpg 455w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/819494331-229x300.jpg 229w" sizes="(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hey Calgary, I&#039;m hot and available and good in the corners!</p></div>Thank God as I mentioned it was all a bad dream because even though ValKat was in the skate off against Kelly, they will be in the FINALLY next week. And yes, I misspelled that on purpose.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s that you say? What do those things have to do with hockey? If you&#8217;re Theo Fleury and Todd Warriner you get dressed up as John Travolta in tight white pants and hot purple sparkles and skate to &#8220;Saturday Night Fever&#8221; and die a slow sad death. If you&#8217;re Todd, you cross dress you&#8217;re way almost out of the competition skating to &#8220;Brick House&#8221; if Theo hadn&#8217;t almost dropped his partner on her head!</p>

<p>This week&#8217;s theme was &#8220;From screen to stage&#8221; &#8230; ahhh. It was more like theme songs from Disaster Movies. I also keep waiting for Kurt Browning and Ron Maclean to start making out at the beginning of each program. They stare into each others eyes so deeply it&#8217;s startling. It would also be highly entertaining. More so than some of the skating!</p>
<p>But on to what is REALLY important &#8211; How did Val skate? AWESOME &#8211; what else would you expect? He pulled another hat trick this week scoring two sixes from the judges! He skated to &#8220;From Russia with Love&#8221;. I&#8217;ve provided the video below because really, words simply don&#8217;t do his performance justice. ICE ICE BABY!</p>

<p>Again this week they put ValKat in the bottom two when they are by far and away the best skaters &#8211; which makes me think <strong>Canadian&#8217;s are Russian skater-haters!</strong> Seriously, I don&#8217;t think my blood pressure can take many more of these episodes. Patrice and Shae-Lynn had a far less difficult routine but scored the highest so far this season &#8211; but riddle me this Batman? ValKat have done two firsts in three routines for BOTB &#8211; double lutz and a double throw. So how can they be continuously in the bottom two? Even in this shirt smokin&#8217; hot Val does not deserve to go home and thank god &#8211; he didn&#8217;t! My life will go on! But my inner publicist says &#8211; Val &#8211; don&#8217;t let them show you having a snit. Not good PR. Next week think warm and fuzzy! Keep it hot &#8211; you know how to! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>If Canada would allow US residences to vote, I think this would have a completely different result but they won&#8217;t allow us to &#8211; which totally blows!</p>
<p>As I write this, Mr. Cherrie is watching <em>Men with Brooms</em>, another Canadian show and the vending machine is tormenting one of the characters &#8211; with a RUSSIAN ACCENT &#8211; OK &#8211; don&#8217;t make me go there &#8211; again &#8211; I will turn to Johnny Weir! While words really can&#8217;t do justice to anything Johnny-Weir-esque: He looks like a bastard child of Ziggy Stardust and something Sarah Palin shot down from a plane in Alaska and God bless him for it! Now that&#8217;s entertainment&#8230;<br />
