				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ll be the first to admit that our coverage of the players in the Western Conference is limited.</p>
<p>Our Foxy Fridays tend to have a more&#8230;shall we say, biased skew.  But you can&#8217;t really fault us when our favorite teams are in the East Coast, that tends to happen.</p>
<p>You can imagine our delight when one of our twitter followers (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/elishajaffer">@elishajaffer</a> all the way from Dar es Saalam, Tanzania!) suggested <strong>Jonathan Ericsson</strong> as a potential Foxy Friday.  Perfect!  A chance to expand our horizons and troll the Western Conference team for individuals worthy of such an honor.</p>
<p>We did a google search.  And a new love was born.</p>

<li>He&#8217;s Swedish.  You all know how we feel about Swedish hockey players.  They breed them goooood over there.  Two words &#8211; Henrik Lundqvist.</li>
<li>He&#8217;s a 6&#8217;4&#8243;, 218 lbs defenseman for an Original Six hockey franchise.<a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ericsson-jonathan-baseball-hat.jpg">

<li>He started his career at center but after <strong>playing one game on defense</strong> for his junior team, a Red Wings scout convinced him to play defense.  The team then drafted him that summer in the 2002 Entry Draft.</li>
<li>Speaking of drafts, he was the <strong>LAST player selected in 2002</strong>.  Dead. Freaking. Last.  Nothing motivates a player more than being picked last.  Just ask Phil Kessel.</li>
<li>In 2011, he signed a fatty of a contract with the Wings &#8211; three-years, $9.75 million.  <strong>He&#8217;s making in rain up in hurrrrr.</strong></li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After seeing this clip last night I had a dream that Kris Letang shoveled me off the ice with his stick just like this. I don&#8217;t remember anything else because Poe decided to start yowelling like there was no tomorrow per his usual 4:00AM good morning Mom, I&#8217;m hungry &#8211; feed me now please. I presume it was because I was stalking I mean, we were playing a friendly game of WUYS shinny hockey because I vaguely remember wearing a jersey with those letters on it and Pants screaming with laugher that she was going to pee her pants. I don&#8217;t really ice skate well enough for this which was probably why I was escorted off the ice. Anyway, this clip was what prompted the dream.</p>
<p>Niklas Knonwall of the Detroit Red Wings shoveled his team-mate Patrick Eaves, off the ice, during a power play when they were short-handed, after he had blocked a shot and he was injured. Hilarious, yes but wow, give the guy a second, he just made a brilliant play to stop a goal and sacrificed his body. Detroit is a machine. But dude, get some feelings.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is nothing like your first love. Mind you, as Mr. Cherrie has warned me, you never really want to delve too deeply into these guys lives. Once you start peeling back the layers, it&#8217;s not like a Tootsie pop with a juicy, gooey, sweet chocolatey center. It&#8217;s more like an onion that makes you cry more and more. So let&#8217;s just be our normal superficial selves and stay with the surface, shall we? Because really, I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s all that&#8217;s really going on there anyway. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>He is the top US born goal scoring hockey player EVER! Note how Canadians need to point out US born? Got a  moose on that shoulder? WHO CARES? He&#8217;s hot! He&#8217;s shirtless! When recently interviewed on HNIC he said, uncensored, in no uncertain terms, would he never appear on BATTLE OF THE BLADES! <strong>Never say never Mikey Pants!</strong></p>
<p>He&#8217;s won a Stanley Cup!<strong> Shut up, Mr. Cherrie. It was Brett Hull who cheated. Mikey did not.</strong></p>
<p>We will not mention who he married. That does not matter. As for the rest of the stats, do we really care? This post is FOXY FRIDAY, not MENSA MEN.  So I give you your MOMENTS OF MIKEY. Enjoy. I certainly do. He was my first but not my last. I still keep his hockey card by my bed at night.</p>
