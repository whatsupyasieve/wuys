				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night&#8217;s Bruins vs. Pens was pretty good&#8230;until the 3rd period.</p>
<p>That is when the Pens&#8217; offence sprang to life and took advantage of some uncharacteristic mistakes by my beloved Bruins.  Pens scored 3 goals in under 5 minutes and went on to defeat the Bruins 3-2.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m not making excuses [because there is no crying in hockey] but the Bruins<strong> did</strong> play night before in Ottawa and then had to hop on the plane to Pittsburgh.  Fatigue had to factor it at least a little bit.</p>

<p>Bruins&#8217; #2 goaltender Anton &#8220;Dobby&#8221; Khudobin got the start and was stellar against the Pens&#8217; potent offence.  Didn&#8217;t catch the game? Just check out the <a href="http://video.bruins.nhl.com/videocenter/console?hlg=20122013,2,380&amp;event=PIT82&amp;lang=en">video clips here</a>.  Most all of the saves clips are Khudobin&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Dobby has save after save after great save.  He was strong and aggressive in the net, especially on the Pens&#8217; 5-on-3 when things could have got real ugly, real fast.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t fault him for the loss because the 3 goals that the Pens did score were all good goals.  And really when the Pens score against you, pretty much all of their goals are good goals.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Dobby make saves.  No allow goals. Dobby happy.</em></p>
<p>I love <strong>Dennis Seidenberg</strong> as a player and think that he is seriously underrated.  But last night&#8217;s game was sweet and sour for our favorite German.</p>
<p>He made a ridiculous play to save a goal&#8230;then made a ridiculous mistake that was the final nail in the coffin for the Bruins.</p>
<p>Hockey gods giveth and hockey gods taketh away.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Yeah, I know how you feel buddy.</em></p>
<p>This was definitely a game that the Bruins could have won.  They only but 16 shots on Fleury and with the way he&#8217;s been playing lately, this was a missed opportunity.  They should have peppered him with shots, sent Lucic in there to crash the net, and screened him all night long.  Had they done that, the outcome might have been very different.</p>
<p>Seguin&#8217;s goal was tres impressive.  (Watch it <a href="http://video.bruins.nhl.com/videocenter/console?hlg=20122013,2,380&amp;event=PIT82&amp;cmpid=embed-share-video">here</a>.)  Being able elevate the puck like that while moving away from said puck &#8211; Skillz, people.  They don&#8217;t teach that in school.</p>
<p>Over the last few games, Seguin seems to have found his groove. He&#8217;s skating well, finding the puck, and looks like his scoring touch has returned. Add to that the great play of his line mates,  Bergeron and Marchand,and the Bruins&#8217; 1st line is just chugging away like a little train.  Choo Choo! All aboard!</p>
<p>Bruins vs. Pens face off again this Sunday, March 17th.</p>
<p>This time, we&#8217;re gonna have the luck of the Irish on our side.</p>

<p>I know.  I can&#8217;t stop laughing either.  So much hilarity.</p>
<p>My feed didn&#8217;t actually show the fight because it happened behind the play and Tyler Seguin happened to be on his way to score an empty-netter to seal the win for the Black and Gold.</p>
<p>Luckily for us all, I scoured the internet and DID manage to find some footage of this &#8220;fight&#8221;</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/1ozdCJJ6osg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, we want the Professor and our intern to get along. It makes for a much more harmonious office atmosphere.  But if they HAVE to fight, we much prefer this sort of fighting.  Less chances of black eyes.</p>
<p>In other game notes&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Nathan Horton straight up embarrassed J. Staal</strong>.  Like right out of his shorts. [Watch <a href="http://video.bruins.nhl.com/videocenter/console?hlg=20122013,2,73&amp;event=CAR504&amp;cmpid=embed-share-video">this pretty goal</a>.]</p>
<p>Honestly, Jordan.  Where you even <strong>paying attention</strong>?  Or where you thinking &#8220;Man, I could really go for a sandwich right now?&#8221;  Or did you momentarily turn into a cat and get distracted by a laser pointer on the ice?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad that Horton scored because I want him to score all the goals, but really, Jordan. You know better than that.</p>

<p><strong>Dougie Hamilton is making everyone fall in love with him. </strong> The kid continues to reward the Bruins organization&#8217;s faith in him by playing like a big boy.  Last night, he set up David Krecji with t<a href="http://video.bruins.nhl.com/videocenter/console?hlg=20122013,2,73&amp;event=CAR666&amp;cmpid=embed-share-video">his salty, no-look dish</a>.</p>
<p>The 19-year-old rookie now was 4 points in his first 5 games of his professional career.</p>
<p>I will now refer to him as the <strong>Great Hambino</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Anton Khudobin is a-okay</strong>.  While last night&#8217;s game wasn&#8217;t by any means a goaltending showcase, Bruins back up Anton Khudobin played very well, allowing Bruins fans to breath a small sigh of relief.  Tuukka will of course be the Bruins #1 this season, but should he need a break, I think were going to be alright with the <a href="http://bruins.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=652988">man from Kazakhstan between the pipes</a>.</p>
