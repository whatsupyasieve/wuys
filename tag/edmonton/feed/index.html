<p>Look how happy he makes this little girl! Â She doesn&#8217;t even have teeth!</p>
<p>Someone should tell her this is it, as good as it gets. Â She can pretty much give up now. Â Unless RNH comes along &#8211; he&#8217;s her age, right?</p>

I was feeling like the only LA King&#8217;s fan in the WORLD and I may still be. But HNIC&#8217;sÂ big game this weekend was Edmonton VS LA KING&#8217;s and not only were we treated to a special highlight of LA KINGS Legendary Goalie RogieÂ Vachon, it was basically a <strong>DREW DOUGHTY LOVE-FEST! ALL OF CANADA</strong>, or at least all the staff at HNICÂ is in love with DREW &#8216;TOUCHED BY GOD&#8217; DOUGHTY. While the Washington Capitals have the Ovechcam, a camera solely focused on everything Ovechkin &#8211; total GOLD &#8211; this game had a <strong>DREW DOUGHTY-CAM</strong>.</p>

He also got the first star of the game, had his third goal of the season, a crushing hip check on Taylor Hall which led to yet another interview, with Taylor Hall &#8211; ABOUT DREW &#8216;TOUCHED BY GOD&#8217; DOUGHTY! and a huge dog pile on Drew, (he&#8217;s at the bottom of this pile) which he took like a man and came out smelling like a rose!</p>

<p>All and all, one of the BEST HNICÂ ALL YEAR! Also because LA won! Of course, until NEXT WEEK when the Capitals take Toronto! They love to hate Ovi! But last time OviÂ was on HNICÂ they all but creamed their pants over him so can&#8217;t wait for that one. THAT WILL BE A SHOW. Two weeks in a row &#8230; GOD BLESS CANADAÂ and HNIC! The Great Grapes will gripe and groan and OviÂ will love it all! Whether he scores or not, Ovi always puts on a show for them. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
