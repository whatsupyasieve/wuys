				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>So to quote many a hockey player and coach, hockey is 90% mental and 10% physical.</strong> OK &#8211; I&#8217;ll buy that for a hot second since it was regurgitated out of Kris Letang&#8217;s luscious mouth recently. (I&#8217;m paraphrasing him more intelligently.) Where I am I going with this? Is it me or are many teams suffering A LOT of injuries lately? I was perusing the IR HOT LIST for the Caps and noticed BAMM-SCOOBY DOO &#8211; there are a lot of players out. I was watching the Freeway Face-off last night (<strong>because my beautiful double D TBG was playing</strong>) and wondering where Frankenface was AKA Getzlaf. Out. Injured. I&#8217;m not going to list all the major playas who are out or have been out because if you&#8217;re a fan, you already know the who&#8217;s who of Boo-boo ville.</p>

<p>However, I do have a great quote from BB of the Caps about Backstrom from his EPIC showdown hair on hair scrap with Letang on Monday. <strong>See, Nicky B has not missed a game in his entire NHL career which would be 307 games!</strong> Impressed? I knew you would be. And even though the Hot Mop out of Pit fractured the Hot Mop from Sweden&#8217;s thumb, Nicky B. is still planning on playing tomorrow because according to BB, ‚Äú<strong>I‚Äôm saying he‚Äôs playing tomorrow. He‚Äôs fine. He‚Äôs got a sore ouchie that‚Äôs not preventing him from playing. He‚Äôs a tough kid.‚Äù</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_3382" style="width: 481px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><strong><strong><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/25364_1410953999773_1410185119_1123477_4927689_n.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3382 " title="25364_1410953999773_1410185119_1123477_4927689_n" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/25364_1410953999773_1410185119_1123477_4927689_n.jpg" alt="" width="471" height="269" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/25364_1410953999773_1410185119_1123477_4927689_n.jpg 471w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/25364_1410953999773_1410185119_1123477_4927689_n-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px" /></a></strong></strong><p class="wp-caption-text">mikey may be kissing nickys boo-boo and more if he misses a game</p></div>
<p>So all the hot hair is not just covering access to brain matter or keeping their heads warm, it evidently is covering a 90% mental desire to play hockey &#8211; I was never any good at math &#8211; whatever. Too bad all that hockey gear covers like 100% of all that hockey body hotness! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> If only we could get them to play the All Star Game naked! <strong>Someone get me Brendan Shanahan on the phone NOW!</strong> I have a brilliant idea for next year!</p>
