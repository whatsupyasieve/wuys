				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok &#8211; I&#8217;m going to apologize upfront here. I&#8217;ve never read a comic book &#8211; EVER.  Not once. And it took marrying Mr. Cherrie for me to discover the greatness of hockey and that is after many years of married bliss. Even when he first pointed out Ovi, I glanced up from reading my Glamour Magazine, saw a zit-face Cro-magnon freak, stared blankly at Mr. Cherrie, gave him the obligatory wife nod, and went back to the fashion do&#8217;s and don&#8217;t section and immediately forgot about him.</p>
<p>Where am I going with this? Well Stan Lee created THE GUARDIAN PROJECT where each day until the All Star game he is revealing an NHL &#8216;guardian&#8217; based on each NHL team. Sounds cool? If you are a comic book nerd. I suppose it&#8217;s a wet dream of a life time. Really. Honest. And if you are a hockey-comic-book nerd, you&#8217;ve hit the mega-millions!</p>
<p>﻿<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/4y1obrCAvio?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>But you know what? I had a deja-vu moment. Mr. Cherrie was prattling on about this Stan Lee Guardian Project and superheroes and all I heard was the NHL and superheroes and I kept waiting for the villain Stanley. I kept waiting for &#8216;cup&#8217; to follow Stanley. But it didn&#8217;t. Finally in exasperation I asked, &#8220;What does the Stanley Cup have to do with all this?!&#8221; This time it was Mr. Cherrie staring blankly back at me. &#8220;The Stanley Cup? What are you talking about?&#8221; Then it dawned on him what I meant and he started laughing. &#8220;I bet no one else in the world would even think that but you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Gee thanks! Really? Come on? No one? No one. No one else hears STAN LEE and the NHL and is waiting to hear CUP drop after all that? SERIOUSLY?! Well then, I guess I&#8217;m just blessed with a lovely dry sense of humor.</p>
<p>But if you want to check out all the fabulous superheroes created by STAN LEE and not the STANLEY CUP, go to <a href="http://www.guardianproject30.com">www.guardianproject30.com</a> or if you&#8217;re single and want to impress your comic-book nerd neighbor and get a date, send him there, he&#8217;ll be impressed that you know about it. And no need to thank me, thank Mr. Cherrie.</p>
