				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[brightcove vid=557985342001&amp;exp3=594258040001&amp;surl=http://c.brightcove.com/services&amp;pubid=1815805388&amp;pk=AQ~~,AAAAAGw6_cw~,orja1xhYdu3rs6LhvI2eES_NASP2XRmD&amp;w=416&amp;h=312]</p>
<p>OK, I will confess to being a bit of a Classical Music nerd having sat through Wagner&#8217;s Ring Cycle &#8211; and no, that is not a horror movie trilogy. I was watching Dancing with the Stars so I could watch Maks drop Kristie Alley again like a shot putter over loaded at the Olympics! But instead, Mr. Cherrie found me talking to the TV at this Hottie for Classical Music theme night. I just rolled my eyes and told Mr. Cherrie I could see through the window dressing and that his guy was GOOD &#8211; no GREAT! <strong>He can play &#8220;The Flight of Bumble Bee&#8221; in 66 seconds &#8211; a world record!</strong></p>
<p>And then I thought, &#8220;Hey &#8211; we had a blow out last year about  &#8211; he who I won&#8217;t name for fear of being flash mobbed by his fans again &#8211; <strong>WHY NOT start early and suggest David Garrett?</strong> International yet Half-American! Young, hip and HOT! I think this would work! Hockey fans might actually appreciate this guy who would bring some flash and totally rock BOTH anthems &#8220;O Canada&#8221; and &#8220;The Star Spangle Banner&#8221; &#8211; ala Jimi Hendrix Style and bring some much needed Pazzaz to the game. Oh say can you see &#8230; Oh hell yes! I say!</p>
<p>I know it&#8217;s the play-offs and why am I going on about the All-Star game? BECAUSE &#8230; that&#8217;s how my brain works sisters. You should all know that by now! And BTW &#8211; you should totally down load ROCK SYMPHONIES on iTunes like, NOW because you will LOVE IT!</p>
