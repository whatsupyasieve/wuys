				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who knew Winnipeg was such a helpful city? In addition to being the hometown of Jonathan Toews (and others), they held an actual vote to determine the best looking member of their NHL team.</p>
<p><strong>Canada: Using Democracy for Real Things!</strong></p>
<p>The result probably surprised no one except Evander Kane, who retaliated with a sweatpants-based protest, subsequent injury and trade. There&#8217;s only room for one &#8220;Hottest Jet,&#8221; honey:</p>
<p><strong>Foxy Friday: Ondrej Pavelec</strong></p>

<p><em>(Thanks for <a href="https://twitter.com/Kailz_H">@Kailz_H </a>for the suggestion! Twitter won&#8217;t let me scroll back to last Thursday, which is a nice way of telling us we talk too much.)</em></p>
<p>Now, if I said &#8220;Ondrej Pavelec,&#8221; most people would say &#8220;Bless you.&#8221; Some hockey fans might say, &#8220;That goalie who fainted?&#8221; That is true &#8211; Pavelec fainted in-game against Washington back in 2010, while playing for the Thrashers. He suffered a concussion upon hitting the ice, but it was diagnosed as a fainting spell, and not career-threatening. The story goes he woke up in the hospital and asked about the score (Atlanta won).</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-21978 aligncenter" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pav6.jpg" alt="pav6" width="383" height="363" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pav6.jpg 383w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pav6-300x284.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /></p>
<p>If you think he looks a bit like #TeamEbs, I say you&#8217;re right. He bears a more-than-passing though less-than-gapped resemblance to another blue-eye Western Conference Foxy Friday selection.</p>
<p>Though I doubt Ebs could pull off this Eurohipster disguise:</p>
<p><img class=" size-large wp-image-21973 aligncenter" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pav2-500x129.jpg" alt="pav2" width="500" height="129" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pav2-500x129.jpg 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pav2-300x77.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pav2.jpg 627w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>What&#8217;s that about a beard? Oh, you said, &#8220;YES?&#8221;</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-21976 aligncenter" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pav31.jpg" alt="pav3" width="400" height="413" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pav31.jpg 400w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pav31-290x300.jpg 290w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>Or were you referring to this hat?</p>
<p><img class=" size-large wp-image-21975 aligncenter" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pav4.jpg" alt="pav4" width="236" height="373" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pav4.jpg 236w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pav4-189x300.jpg 189w" sizes="(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px" /></p>
<p>Ondrek is Czech, from the same region (Kladno District) as Michael Frolik, Jaromir Jagr, Tomas Plekanec, Jiri Sekac, Jiri Tlusty, and Jakub Voracek.  Not bad for an area roughly 275 square miles.  They are all best friends and they love each other and do sports.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-22064 aligncenter" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pav41.jpg" alt="pav4" width="548" height="342" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pav41.jpg 548w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pav41-300x187.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pav41-500x312.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px" /></p>
<p>Note the plaid shorts, a worldwide phenomenon.  While jeans like this are only available in Europe and Russia through The Ovechkin Collection:</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-22065 aligncenter" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pav61.jpg" alt="pav6" width="395" height="565" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pav61.jpg 395w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pav61-210x300.jpg 210w" sizes="(max-width: 395px) 100vw, 395px" /></p>
<p>This is about our limit for distressing on &#8220;These old thing?&#8221; brand new designer jeans.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-22088 aligncenter" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pavs1.png" alt="pavs1" width="381" height="465" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pavs1.png 381w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pavs1-246x300.png 246w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /></p>
<p>Pavelec has played 324 NHL games over 7+ seasons. His current  2.60 GAA is a career best, though his top ye<a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=21970&amp;action=edit&amp;message=10#">Add Media</a>ar was &#8217;11-&#8217;12, in which he won 29 games. The Jets are currently 4th in the tough Central Division with 73 points, and would be Wild Card spot #1 if the playoffs began today. (Warning: Stats from Thursday, because Friday has a &#8216;no math&#8217; policy.)</p>
<p>Ondrej is in the third year of a five-year/$19.5 mill contract that leaves him UFA in 2017.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-22061 aligncenter" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pav2.png" alt="pav2" width="502" height="364" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pav2.png 502w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pav2-300x218.png 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pav2-500x363.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px" /></p>
<p>My favorite thing about the Winnipeg Jets website is that you can misspell Pavelec as Pavalec and still get 40 photo results. It&#8217;s nice to know mine are not the only fat fingers in the business.</p>
<p>The Jets have a program called Reading Takes Flight where players visit schools and read them a children&#8217;s book about the Jets. Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://jets.nhl.com/club/gallery.htm?id=52221&amp;iid=1971644">full photo gallery</a>, feel free to stop when you get teary-eyed.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-22060 aligncenter" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pav1.png" alt="pav1" width="398" height="532" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pav1.png 398w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pav1-224x300.png 224w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px" /></p>
<p>Ondrej has been on a lot of Czech talk shows, which you can find on youTube. You won&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re saying, but hey, Foxy Friday isn&#8217;t really about that.  Here&#8217;s an interview from before this season began, featuring English and our beloved beard-plus-hoodie combination:</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/MoyFf33jhWA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Since he knows we love part time models, Ondrej starred in possibly the oddest (and longest) hockey player TV ad I&#8217;ve ever seen. The sign says &#8220;Hi, my name is Ondrej Pavelec,&#8221; but that is false. You might be Pavelec&#8217;s belt buckle, though I am pretty sure you are not Ondrej at all. If you had his face, you&#8217;d use it.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/JRSM6EdYf20?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Ondrej does not have a Twitter, so you&#8217;ll have to go to a game and ask him out with a sign like the old days. In the meantime, you can follow his goalie pads (they lead a full life) at <a href="https://twitter.com/pavelecspads">@pavelecspads</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Happy Friday!</strong></p>
