				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, I&#8217;m going THERE &#8230;AGAIN.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a direct quote from for NHL guidelines with regards to player contact with fans.</p>
<p>Following is an excerpt from the section that addressed &#8220;Contact with Fans&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;Under no circumstances are Club personnel &#8212; either players or non-players &#8212; permitted to have physical contact with fans, or enter, or attempt to enter the stands. Even where a fan is verbally abusive, intoxicated, or profane, Club personnel should either ignore the conduct or, where appropriate, seek the assistance of police or security personnel at the arena.</p>
<p>&#8220;Accordingly, please be on notice that all Club personnel (management, coaches, trainers, and/or players) who engage in any form of physical contact with fans, including the squirting of water, will, on a going forward basis, be subject to discipline in the form of a suspension.&nbsp; The Club involved will also be subject to a fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, Pants knows from various off-line chats&nbsp;we have, well, let&#8217;s just say I an active imagination and maybe some NSFW&nbsp;comments. But what if say Pants, or Chuck or I, were to&nbsp;lure one of our favorite players away before, during or after a game but still on-site would they still be fined for contact with a fan? Does this cover that kind of contact? What if it&#8217;s consensual? Because if I got that close to Ovi,&nbsp;&nbsp;Miika, Brodeur&nbsp;or Fedorov, I&#8217;m pretty sure it would look something like this:</p>
