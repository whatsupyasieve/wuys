<p>I&#8217;m sure that his great player and all around awesomeness contributed greatly to his nomination but you can&#8217;t discount the <strong>Foxy Friday Effect</strong>.</p>
<p>It sorta magical.  Like the &#8220;Felix Felicitas&#8221; potion from Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Shawn&#8230;you&#8217;re welcome, buddy.</p>
<p>Below is the presser about #22&#8217;s nomination (courtesy of ﻿﻿<a href="http://bruins.nhl.com">bruins.nhl.com</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<h6>Bruins forward <a href="http://bruins.nhl.com/club/player.htm?id=8465978">Shawn Thornton</a> is the Boston Bruins 2011 Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy nominee, as selected by the Boston chapter of the Professional Hockey Writer’s Association (PHWA).  The Masterton Trophy is given to the player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey.</h6>
<h6>“One of the most popular Bruins in recent memory, Thornton&#8217;s perseverance in the pursuit of his NHL dreams and dedication to the community embody exactly what the Masterton Trophy is designed to honor,” said Joe Haggerty, PHWA Boston chapter chairman and Bruins beat reporter for CSNNE.com.</h6>
<h6>Before Thornton earned a Stanley Cup ring with the Anaheim Ducks, he had spent nine seasons between the Toronto and Chicago organizations trying to earn a full-time NHL role. Thornton was traded to the Bruins following his Stanley Cup victory and since has become a mainstay in Boston’s lineup. This season Thornton has achieved career highs in goals and points (9-9=18), but without compromising the physical aspect of his game that he is known for. Thornton leads the team in penalty minutes with 122.</h6>
<h6>A leader off the ice as well as on, the Charlestown, MA year-round resident received the 2010 John Bucyk Award for his community contributions. Last summer, Thornton organized the first annual “Putts and Punches for Parkinson&#8217;s” golf tournament to raise money for the American Parkinson Disease Association. Thornton is also a key player in the annual Cuts for A Cause charity event, where fans bid to shave participating Bruins’ heads and the funds are donated to the Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center.</h6>
<h6>The winner of the Masterton Trophy is selected by a vote of the 30 chapters of the PHWA at the conclusion of the regular season. The winner will be announced at the NHL Awards, which will be held on Wednesday, June 22 in Las Vegas.</h6>
