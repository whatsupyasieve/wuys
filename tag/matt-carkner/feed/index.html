				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s getting hot in here, and Brendan Shanahan&#8217;s phone was ringing off the hook yesterday.  Three players face disciplinary hearings for offenses committed during Saturday&#8217;s run of show&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Carl Hagelin</strong></p>
<p>Former Foxy Friday and Ryan Gosling stun- double Carl Hagelin is not known for throwing elbows and getting dirrrty.  But the playoffs make people do crazy things.  He took out Daniel Alfredsson with a very high hit yesterday.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/jE5Nz2efcW8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>Alfredsson, the Sens&#8217; captain, did not return to the game.  There&#8217;s been no update on Alfredsson&#8217;s status.  Hagelin served a five minute major and will be sentenced today.  Tortorella said &#8220;wah!&#8221; but that&#8217;s what he always says.</p>
<p><strong>2. Matt Carkner</strong></p>
<p>This guy is off his anger-management meds.  Boyle had a goal in game 1 and got into it with Karlsson to the tune of matching roughing minors.  It merits the clean check Carkner throws to start this, and probably a fight.  I understand protecting your most valuable asset.  But Carkner doesn&#8217;t square off, he jumps Boyle and drags him face-down across the ice under the dogpile.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/bInRP2-B8Ug?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>Carkner got five for fighting, two for instigating and ejected.  Brandon Dubinsky was the third man into the fight and also got himself a game misconduct.  He took his frustration out on the Gatorade cooler.</p>

			<span class="xc_pin" onclick="pin_this(event, 'http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://whatsupyasieve.com/2012/04/15/principals-office/&amp;media=http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/gatorade.gif&amp;description=Principal&#039;s Office')">
			</span>

	</p>
<p>This series is officially ugly.  I think Shanahan will suspend Hagelin for one game, especially if Alfie can&#8217;t play tomorrow.  The hit was directly to the head and otherwise you open it up to chaos.  If Carkner went after Boyle for a play that didn&#8217;t result in Karlsson being injured, what will they do to the guy who knocked out their captain?  Hagelin is not Boyle &#8211; he may not live to tell the tale.</p>
<p>Carkner definitely gets suspended here.  Fight a guy clean to protect your teammates, that&#8217;s hockey.  This is cowardice and can&#8217;t be allowed to stand.</p>
<p><strong>3. Andrew Shaw</strong></p>
<p>Goalies are like virgins whose fathers are right inside the front door with a shotgun &#8211; don&#8217;t touch them, it&#8217;s not worth it.  Chicago&#8217;s Andrew Shaw collided with Phoenix netminder Mike Smith last night, helmet-to-helmet. Smith went down hard and stayed there for a long time.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/-rELP0bYLg4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>Shaw got a five minute charging major, on which the Coyotes scored to take the lead.  He was ejected as well.  Smith eventually got right and stayed in the game&#8230; what?  He must have passed whatever on-ice tests are administered immediately following a hit to the head, but this looked like a mandatory trip to the quiet room.  I think a five + game should suffice as Smith wasn&#8217;t injured on the play.  The hearing is tomorrow.</p>
<p>What do you think?  More importantly, if they don&#8217;t get what the opposition feels they &#8220;deserve,&#8221; what happens in game three?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fist off, I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m writing about the Penguins. Secondly, yes, this is a few days late but between an emergency vet visit on Christmas Day, (Moe ate curling ribbon &#8211; still waiting for it to come out the other end &#8211; oh joy!) the food coma I&#8217;ve been in and the pants I&#8217;m stuck in from the afore-mentioned food coma, not a pretty sight. So I&#8217;ve finally rolled off the couch and made it to the lap top. Actually, I managed to pull it over to me without disconnecting the internet. HA! Note to self, sweat pants next year- more forgiving.</p>
<p>Anyway, because I had nothing better to do, I was watching the Penguins get <strong>SPANKED</strong> by Ottawa this weekend as Pants failed to mention in her post about Sid&#8217;s horrendous stache situation. There was a glorious fight between Godard and Carkner where Godard got popped and popped<strong> HARD </strong>by Carkner several times. You couldn&#8217;t really tell until they were pulled apart like the girls from the Duran Duran video &#8220;Girls on Film&#8221; but Godard was bleeding and went to the locker room. End of story &#8211; right? NO.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/xATBwIBNw9E?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>Godard comes back and like a kid dropped on his head too many times, tried to go AGAIN with Carkner. WHY? They show Godard on the bench draining his eye. It&#8217;s swollen SHUT. He looks like a Cabbage Patch kid. It wasn&#8217;t like Carnker started the first fight. It wasn&#8217;t like Carnker was taunting him. But when Godard got back on the ice, he grabbed Carkner and wanted to dance with him again. To Carkner&#8217;s credit, he kept his gloves and stick. You could tell he kept saying he wasn&#8217;t going to go. But Godard evidently needed a hug or something. Godard got a ten minute game misconduct and sent packing.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/XiPI5rKr-B8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>The point of the post?<strong> I CAN&#8217;T WAIT TO SEE WHAT 24/7 HAS TO SAY ABOUT THIS! INQUIRING MINDS WANT TO KNOW!</strong> We many never know what Carkner was thinking but WTF &#8211; Godard &#8230;.? Tune in tomorrow because I hope Godard remembers.</p>
