				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What?! Yeah &#8230; those crazy Canadians! It&#8217;s the second week of Battle of the Blades and this week&#8217;s theme was <strong>BRINGING SEXY BACK </strong>but trust me, Justin Timberlake was <strong>NO WHERE IN SIGHT</strong>! It came down to Tom Warner and Georges Laraque in the final skate off.</p>
<p>Tom skated to Bret Michael&#8217;s &#8220;Every Rose Has It&#8217;s Thorn&#8221; and I could hear Bret already cashing his royalty cheque (that&#8217;s Canadian for check to you US peeps) before the ink was dry and JR had finished taking a cold shower. Tom and his skating skank did something called shooting the dick, I mean, shooting the duck &#8211; I&#8217;m surprised JR didn&#8217;t make that slip! But JR did say that he would have split his pants and pulled both his hammies if he had tried that moved. Me thinks he would have pulled a few other things too!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><div id="attachment_714" style="width: 289px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/5aa5b7c8-8beb-497c-bb22-9042229b7b93-medium1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-714 " title="5aa5b7c8-8beb-497c-bb22-9042229b7b93.Medium[1]" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/5aa5b7c8-8beb-497c-bb22-9042229b7b93-medium1.jpg" alt="" width="279" height="384" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/5aa5b7c8-8beb-497c-bb22-9042229b7b93-medium1.jpg 465w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/5aa5b7c8-8beb-497c-bb22-9042229b7b93-medium1-217x300.jpg 217w" sizes="(max-width: 279px) 100vw, 279px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Goodbye Georges ...</p></div>Anywho ..moving on to one of my personal faves, Georges skated to Seal&#8217;s &#8220;A Kiss From a Rose&#8221; with his little adorable skating munchkin. He didn&#8217;t quite bring sexy back but he did skate well and do a double throw &#8211; far better technically than Tom but because he didn&#8217;t provide sexual favors, he got the boot.  BOO-HISS! But he was gracious in his exit and I will miss seeing him.</p>
<p>Now, I also have to add that ValKat tied for the lead technically giving a breath taking performance to 007&#8217;s &#8220;The Look of Love&#8221; and frickin&#8217; melted the TV screen &#8211; <strong>NOW THAT <em>WAS</em> SEXY &#8211; YOW!</strong> And I was surprise the ice held up after he skated and didn&#8217;t melt from sheer hottness!</p>
<p>Not the mention the horribly sad interview with Valerie about how he and his family had little to eat when he was growing up in Russia and that is why he is skating for the charity that helps children in poverty all over the world. It was also <strong>HILARIOUS </strong>hearing him slam Florida saying that <strong>&#8220;No one cares about hockey there.&#8221; </strong>hahahahaha Love you, Val! Love you!</p>

Good God! They had the highest score Sunday from the judges. Luckily, the judges have the final say in the skate off and I don&#8217;t think they will let them go&#8230;tonight.</p>
<p>I was going to save this rant for another time, but here it goes. The NHL has allowed their players to play in the Olympics including this past year because CANADA hosted them. NOW &#8211; when RUSSIA is going to host the next Olympics, they are going to possibly revoke NHL players from participating thus that would crush Ovi&#8217;s possibility of winning gold in 2014 &#8211; quite a snub. Even though Ovi has said that no matter what the NHL decides, he is playing in Socchi in 2014. And props to Sidney in supporting Ovi&#8217;s desire.</p>
<p>I rant to Mr. Cherrie about my Hockey Husband Don&#8217;s comments ALL THE TIME that not only Russian hockey players but eastern European players have to play at a level greater than any Canadian hockey player to even be considered to compete on the ice. Yes, Canada you gave us hockey but don&#8217;t whine when someone else can do it better. Step up your game and be glad people love it!</p>
<p>But thank goodness! ValKat escaped the penalty box and even the judges said they shouldn&#8217;t have been in the bottom two. He will live again to ice dance into my heart for next week&#8217;s theme of  .. wait for it &#8230; &#8220;BRINGING SEXY BACK&#8221; oh yeah!</p>

I would predict that they would win this because they simply blew everyone else way with technique. chemistry and movement, but there is no way in h-e-double hockey sticks that Canada is going to let a Russian couple walk away with the title for their highest rated show. And since the couples are voted on by both the judges and the audience, it will be a Canadian couple that wins &#8211; Sorry Valerie but you are a hottie-boom-ba-lottie! You can ice dance with me any time!</div>

	</a><p class="wp-caption-text">he dances like the wind</p></div><strong>2. </strong>The Canadians have engineered some kind of Austin Powers figure skating fembot because these chicks either have some kind of death wish, are on death row and being forced to participate or have already been dropped on their heads so many times they don&#8217;t know any better because there is no way in hell I would let any of these guys touch me let alone throw me in the air or twirl me like a swizzle stick in a cocktail &#8211; many of which I am sure they are still throwing back! (OK &#8211; except for Valerie &#8230; move over Ovi &#8230;. yes, I just said that!)</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Theo Fleury is the Mickey Rourke of Ice Dancing with his guyliner and black fingernail polish. I can&#8217;t believe I just wrote that but I did. And you know what, he looked kind of hot and he skated well. His program wasn&#8217;t as hard as some of the others but his presentation was great.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_560" style="width: 163px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/197theo-thumb-197xauto-427261.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-560" title="197theo-thumb-197xauto-42726[1]" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/197theo-thumb-197xauto-427261.jpg?w=153" alt="" width="153" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">no guyliner here ... </p></div><strong>4. </strong>Georges Laraques did an awesome job and is my sentimental favorite for pure heart, lovability and the fact that JR said he had the biggest a** on figure skates!</p>
<p><div id="attachment_561" style="width: 220px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/georges_laraque1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-561" title="georges_laraque[1]" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/georges_laraque1.jpg?w=210" alt="" width="210" height="300" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/georges_laraque1.jpg 280w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/georges_laraque1-210x300.jpg 210w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">yoga butt is good!</p></div><strong>5. </strong>Which brings me to JR, you just never know what is going to come out of his mouth from out right flirting with the figure skaters &#8211; particularly the Russian cutie to telling everyone oh, wait that&#8217;s #6.</p>
<p><strong>6. </strong>When they started to announce the guest the judge, Mr. Cherrie started to go into apoplectic shock and I knew what was coming because there is only one man who can cause that kind of anger in Mr. Cherrie. I had to put a pillow over his head and sit on him but that didn&#8217;t stop the hockey Tourette&#8217;s that spewed forth about how Brett Hull cheated to win the Stanley Cup for the next hour and half. JR announced to everyone that after his wife had met Brett Hull she was so smitten with him she made him name their son after him. Really? OK, I may have to take back everything I said about JR in my last post. Being sensitive is one thing, being PW&#8217;d is another and then admitting it on national TV is just plain well, I am so tragically devastated I can&#8217;t even go there. Or maybe they have an open marriage and their son really is Brett Hull&#8217;s.</p>
<p><strong>7. </strong>Next week I predict a caribou or musk ox as the guest judge. It&#8217;s Canada &#8230; They gave us BOTB! Why not?</p>
