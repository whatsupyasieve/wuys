<p>Fasth has burst onto the NHL scene in this shortened as the back-up to Jonas Hiller in Anaheim.  Initially, Fasth wasn&#8217;t expected to play much but instead has dominated in a most unexpected way.</p>
<p>The Ducks are on a winning streak and the <strong>rookie goaltender is 4-0 as a starter</strong>.   This week, he got his first NHL shut-out with a 3-0 blanking of the Colorado Avalanche.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/2013/02/08/foxy-friday-viktor-fasth/fasth-viktor-baseball-hat/" rel="attachment wp-att-14750">

<p>Fasth leads the league with <strong>an infinitesimal GAA</strong> and <strong>impressive save percentage</strong>.  In fact, he&#8217;s allowed only 4 goals this season and the Ducks are currently 1st in the Pacific Division and off to their best start since they won the Stanley Cup in 2007.  This upsets <a href="http://www.twitter.com/dooms16">my cousin Tom</a> and WUYS Contributor, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/badmovienite">Aaron</a> very much. (They are both Kings fans).</p>

<p>Coach Bruce Boudreau has a problem that every NHL coach would kill to have &#8211; two great goaltenders, playing well, and winning games.</p>
<p>No doubt that Fasth is a goalie to watch this season, but there are a few other reasons why he is deserving of this honor</p>
<ul>
<li>His name is seriously cool &#8211; Erik Sixten Viktor Fasth.<b>  </b>This is not the name of a hockey player. <strong>This is the name of a Swedish prince</strong>.  Also, his last name amuses us.  No lack of &#8220;Fasth and the Furious&#8221; puns here.  (Side note: Pants is WICKED excited about the new Fast &amp; Furious movie. Like seriously. She loves her some Paul Walker for eva and eva.</li>
<li>He was born in 1982, which makes him 30 years old. <strong>Age-appropriate, ya&#8217;ll.</strong></li>
<li>He has perfected his &#8220;Hey Gurl&#8221; face.</li>
</ul>

<p>The hair.  <strong>The hair alone is worth the honor</strong>.  He seems to have been diligently studying Mike Green and James Neal post game video clips (and this blog) in an effort to achieve that perfect &#8220;undone, yet perfectly done&#8221; look that we so admire.  Mission Accomplished.</li>

<p>Well there you have it &#8211; Sweden wins again.</p>
<p><strong>We love this beautiful country. </strong></p>
<p>Not only for its affordable, yet slightly infuriating to assemble furniture, but more so for their ability to produce countless Foxy Fridays.</p>
<p>Keep &#8217;em coming, Sweden.</p>

<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='480' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/AaJL6q5O3CQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>So here are my highlights and lowlights of the ASG weekend in no particular order:</p>
<p>1. Only in Canada would they <strong>NOT</strong> go to the All Star Game because the <strong>Grand-Slam of Curling is going into Over Time</strong>. Leaving me running around the house in a panic while a large rock slowly drifts down a long runway while a bunch of men rub brushes in front of it.</p>
<p>2. Jonathan Towes is a bit of a gash. Sorry Pants. This weekend only made me dislike him more. He&#8217;s a bit a cry-baby. And I think his team mates think so too. Which is why they did what they did.</p>
<p>3. On the other hand, Jeff Skinner made like the Grinch and STOLE THE ASG weekend! At 18 years old he showed poise, sportsmanship and a knock out smile. Watch out for this one!</p>
<p>4. The CBC mic&#8217;d up Eric Staal the whole game. All I can say is, next year, please put this game on HBO and mic up Fleury because you know Fleury was talking smack all first period. Micing up E. Staal is like micing up Ned Flanders or a bowl of vanilla ice cream, only vanilla ice cream doesn&#8217;t scream like a girl, totes seriously. My cats were really upset during the game.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2775" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ned-flanders1.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2775" title="ned-flanders[1]" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ned-flanders1.jpg?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ned-flanders1.jpg 320w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ned-flanders1-150x150.jpg 150w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ned-flanders1-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">oh gosh ...golly ... I gotta go get that .. acckk!</p></div>5. Contrarily, the third period when Tim Thomas was mic&#8217;d, he was hilarious. Especially</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2776" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/vc127425l1.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2776" title="VC127425l[1]" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/vc127425l1.jpg?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="122" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/vc127425l1.jpg 400w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/vc127425l1-300x244.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">please don&#039;t insult me with that comparison</p></div>when the announcers wouldn&#8217;t stop talking to him and his son texted and told him to stop so Timmy could concentrate! Then they asked about Letang scoring on him Timmy said, &#8220;I made three mistakes on that one: first I didn&#8217;t see the backcheck, second I expected him to pass and third, he took the shot and went up on me. hahahahha.&#8221;</p>
<p>6.Danny Briere. Now I don&#8217;t like him &#8211; AT ALL. And initially I didn&#8217;t think he should be there. But after the CBC interviewed him and his three kids, I&#8217;ve done a 180. When they asked his son what was the best part of the weekend, his son said, &#8220;Spending time with my dad.&#8221; Danny seemed to really need to be there more for his kids&#8217; sake then his ego and watching his son give the interview, Danny seemed on the verge of tears. Strange family dynamics going on there but he obviously really cares about his kids and it meant alot to him to have them there. Total Hallmark moment.</p>
<p>7. The CBC interviewing Fleury about his chat with Ovi after Ovi scored on him in the breakaway challenge. One thing you have to love CBC interviews is there are never any warm up questions. They cut to the chase. So when Scott Oakes opens the interview with Fleury saying, &#8220;So obviously this isn&#8217;t the first time Ovi has scored on you.&#8221;  Nice. Way to warm him up. Awkward. Then he continues asking about the intense rivalry between The Caps and The Penguins and what would they have to talk about. So Fleury just replies, &#8221; I try to remain civil, you know, not throw my stick at him.&#8221; with a big smile. Way to make Scott Oakes go away.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2778" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1086246122.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2778" title="108624612[2]" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1086246122.jpg?w=200" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1086246122.jpg 396w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1086246122-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">what is happening to me? two penguins in a post?</p></div>8. Almost lastly, no matter how much this game &#8216;doesn&#8217;t count&#8217; the first period started out nonchalant but then it got competitive. Not super competitive but you could tell no wanted it be a landslide either way. So when Kris Letang almost took Jonas Hiller&#8217;s head off with a seriously hard shot, he went over to apologize. Even he doesn&#8217;t realize how awesomely hard his shot it.</p>
<p>9. Mike Green a.k.a. Where&#8217;s Waldo? When ever the CBC showed Ovi you got a shot of Kris Letang, which for me, was AWESOME. I already did a post on the best thing that came out of the ASG! I expected to see Mike Green but I got KL. But like, where did Mike Green go? Did he and Ovi have a fight? Was Greenie upset because he got ditched for Kris? Can I blame Ovi?</p>
<p>10. The BEST COMMENT FROM AN ANNOUNCER ON A GOAL EVER: When Briere made his second goal: &#8220;BRIERE JUST WENT UPSTAIRS WHERE NORMAN KEEPS HIS MOTHER!&#8221;</p>
