				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think the Bruins are the best team in hockey.</p>
<p>Yea. I said it.</p>
<p><strong>The Boston Bruins are the best team in the NHL.</strong></p>
<p>Now before you start heckling me and throwing rotten tomatoes and heads of iceberg lettuce,  just hear me out for second.</p>
<p>I know that I may be slightly biased here when it comes to the Bruins but as a &#8220;hockey writer&#8221;, I do have the ability to look at this with some measure of objectivity.</p>
<p>So how do I dare make such a bold statement?  Let&#8217;s look at the facts&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>They have the best goaltending tandem in the NHL.</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>I DEFY to name another goalie super duo better that <strong>Tim Thomas and Tuukka Rask</strong>.  <strong>They are straight up domination</strong>.  Rask is #2 in GAA (1.82). Thomas is #3 (1.84).  Thomas is #2 in Save % (.943). Rask is #3 (.939).  Thomas is #2 in wins (16) and in a 3-way tie for 1st in shutouts (4).   By having two stellar goalies, the Bruins have a distinct advantage through the regular season because you can rest Thomas and give him a night off while still preserving your chance to win even with Rask in the net.  There is not that &#8216;Oh crap&#8221; moment with the backup comes in.  With the B&#8217;s, even the backup is pretty outstanding.  Also, Rask is only 24 years old so just think about what he&#8217;ll be like in three years.  Thomas is the present.  Rask is the future.<a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/thomas-rask.jpg">

</ul>
<li><strong>They are as deep as the ocean is wide.</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Although Chris Kelly does look like he reads &#8220;The Economist&#8221; and you know Andrew Ference watches documentaries on the National Geographic Channel, I&#8217;m not talking about an intellectual depth. I&#8217;m talking about the We-Have-Four-Lines-That-Can-Light-It-Up sort of depth.  <strong><em>Every single line </em>of the Bruins offense can score goals</strong>. Yes, even the Mucking &amp; Grinding 4th line led by Shawn Thornton.  Hell, even the much maligned Benoit Pouliot is scoring goals (he&#8217;s got 6). 1st line not producing?  It&#8217;s cool.  We&#8217;ll come at you with the 2nd and 3rd lines. Coach Claude has a plethora of talent from which he can craft his lines.  He has young talent like Jordan Caron and Zach Hamill that he can call up from Providence at a moment&#8217;s notice who can slip into the Bruins&#8217; lineup without missing a beat.

</ul>
<li><strong>They are low-profile.</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>While the Bruins are an upper echelon NHL team, no one really cares about them. They aren&#8217;t the object of rampant fan-girling (or boying). They&#8217;ll leave that to Jonathan Toews and Sidney Crosby.  They aren&#8217;t gracing the pages of GQ (although they certainly could).  They don&#8217;t have a flashy coach or super star face-of-the-NHL type player (Chara might come close but if you ask me, Patrice Bergeron deserves to be up there). <strong>They are just a straight up, solid hockey club who win hockey games with skill, speed, and quiet tenacity. And an occasional pugilistic endeavor.<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/GDnEmi1qBWc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></strong></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>I know that we are only a little over a third of the way through the season, but I don&#8217;t think that I&#8217;m alone in my thinking that the <strong>Bruins have the potential to repeat as Stanley Cup Champions</strong>.  Now I know it is nigh impossible to repeat <em>and</em> maybe I just jinxed myself <em>and</em> I know it hasn&#8217;t been done since the Red Wings did it in the 1997-98 season, but I&#8217;m holding out this little sliver of hope that it could happen.</p>
<p><strong>And why shouldn&#8217;t it?</strong>  If you get a chance, just watch them play a few games.  Instead of turning on the Pens, or the Caps, or the Hawks game, turn on the Bruins.</p>
<p>I guarantee you&#8217;ll like the hockey you see.</p>
