<p>Kariya had 402 goals and 989 points in 989 career games and played for 15 years.</p>
<p>He probably could have played longer&#8230;were it not for that pesky little villain all hockey fans HATE&#8230;the concussion.</p>
<p>Kariya didn&#8217;t play at all last season as he attempted to recover and his announcement yesterday got me thinking &#8211; <strong>Is Marc Savard next?</strong></p>

<p>I perish the thought but the harsh reality is that it could happen. <strong> But I don&#8217;t wants it to happen!  </strong></p>
<p>With every fiber of my body I want Savvy to <strong>come back in October</strong> refresh, ready, and symptom-free to take his place with the Stanley Cup Champion Boston Bruins.</p>
<p>But I just don&#8217;t know if that is going to happen.  And that makes me one sad panda.</p>
<p><strong>Pants knows how I&#8217;m feeling about all this.</strong>  She&#8217;s patiently waiting for Sidney to recover, leave the comfy confines of Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia and make his way back to da &#8216;Burgh and the love fest that is the Pittsburgh Penguins organization.</p>

<p>Until then, we&#8217;ll just wait all night&#8230;by this hedge&#8230;</p>
