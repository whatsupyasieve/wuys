<p>Today&#8217;s Foxy Friday has played for not one but<strong> TWO</strong> of the teams in the NHL that fuel my hate fire. But today, I will smother that raging hate fire and look past the jersey.</p>
<p>Today, I will also forget that he is named after one of of the Ninja Turtles and will focus on what is really important on this most special and holy of days.</p>
<p>Ladies (and gentlemen?), meet <strong>Raphael Diaz.</strong></p>

<p>This is a man who name invokes images of the Bernabeu, emerald green pitches, and the white noise drone of the vuvuzela, not the Saddledome, sheets of ice, and pop tunes played by a pipe organ.   This 5&#8217;11&#8221; blueliner was born in Zug, Switzerland, which sounds more like an alien race from Doctor Who than an actually place, and he joins fellow Swiss Foxy Friday Honoree <a title="Foxy Friday: Roman Josi" href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/2014/01/03/foxy-friday-roman-josi/">Roman Josi</a> in making us sit up and take notice of that little neutral nation.</p>
<p>We, as true intrepid journalists (!) need to know what other hockey foxes are hiding up there in the Alps.  Is Switzerland the new Sweden?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diaz is a newcomer to the NHL, but has already had quite the journey.  He was signed by the Canadiens in 2011 to an entry level contract. He was traded to the Canucks in February 2014, who then turned around before the ink was even dry and traded him to the Rangers a month later. Then in  October 2014, he went to Calgary&#8217;s camp on a try-out and ended up signing a one-year contract at the start of this season.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot of new jerseys, new locker rooms in new cities, and through it all, he still managed to look like this.</p>
<div style="width: 366px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://40.media.tumblr.com/740e6f569c583d0cbae13f27a0d35f5c/tumblr_mgbmgludpf1rnyqf4o1_1280.jpg" alt="" width="356" height="531" /><p class="wp-caption-text">He works out.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Sidney Crosby and Karl Urban had a baby, Raphael Diaz would be their little bundle of joy.</p>
<div style="width: 255px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0yjk8s6aB1qe46u5o6_r1_250.gif" alt="" width="245" height="217" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hey, girl, hey&#8230;</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diaz is foxy because his role model is obviously John Tavares. As a newbie NHLer, it is important to establish your identity early on.  Diaz is working the &#8220;Accountant-by-day-Hockey-Player-by-night&#8221; look with the best of them.</p>
<p>GET THIS MAN SOME KHAKIS!</p>
<div style="width: 501px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://25stanley.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Raphael-Diaz.jpeg" alt="" width="491" height="400" /><p class="wp-caption-text">I&#8217;ve been waiting for you all night&#8230;by this pineapple</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diaz is truly foxy when he has no idea what we are saying&#8230;</p>
<p><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/997c0f6cbff4abe2c40811ab6d24dbf3/tumblr_mjtz23cKRk1rnyqf4o2_500.gif" alt="" width="500" height="200" /></p>
<div style="width: 255px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://38.media.tumblr.com/46dfceb149ba0d07fdc14dbf63fb0136/tumblr_mhoz4i8US91rnyqf4o2_250.gif" alt="" width="245" height="248" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Only if you insist&#8230;</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8230;And when he&#8217;s acting like a giant toddler.</p>
<p><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m12qbpDZUb1rnyqf4o2_r1_250.gif" alt="" width="250" height="141" /></p>
<p>He is foxy because his eyebrow game is ON POINT, even though his beard game needs a bit of work.</p>
<p><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://36.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lspppoFyDX1qlpk0mo1_400.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="215" /><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://33.media.tumblr.com/3b33c3a3a36c8c4835921a1b7462846b/tumblr_n6mvdhQjj11qgvk7ao1_400.gif" alt="" width="251" height="202" /></p>
<p>But you know what really gets us? Those smile lines around his eyes</p>
<p>Those just destroy every fiber of my being.</p>
<p><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://40.media.tumblr.com/ad3e960055e92501a450a4d33485dc68/tumblr_mlbfrbstGi1rnyqf4o1_1280.jpg" alt="" width="339" height="394" /></p>
<p>So in conclusion&#8230;</p>
<p><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://38.media.tumblr.com/a6699eb1d7ff8a49153681ef7fd35b91/tumblr_mya0w2guMF1rur9qso5_250.gif" alt="" width="245" height="169" /></p>
<p>Yes, Raphael.  I think we just did.</p>
