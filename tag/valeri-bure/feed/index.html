				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok, Pants can totally attest to the fact that I came up with this earlier and I&#8217;m not sharing my idea here but IN THE NEWS &#8230; <strong>the NHL is partnering with Stan Lee&#8217;s SLG Entertainment LLC to create new comic heroes modeled after each team in the league. </strong>I am only going to report on this because I promised not to make fun of a certain player and this would be like shooting fish in a barrel. But I will note that <em><strong>I CAN&#8217;T WAIT</strong></em> to see what they do with Ovi! SQUEEL! I think I just set off all the dogs in the neighborhood again &#8230; oh well. They are used to it.</p>

<p>In other news, last night in BATTLE OF THE BLADES, Valeri wore the most atrocious outfit on earth! But even he can work that and work it he did! He is by far the best technical skater. Are they trying to get him voted off? OK &#8211; don&#8217;t answer that because we know they are. But he could have said no &#8211; I think. Plus, the practice video showed him having a full-on Russian snit-fit. I&#8217;m sure the translation wasn&#8217;t &#8220;Darn &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/EIdbJBsWwpA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>I also have to note that if Kelly Chase doesn&#8217;t finally go home after yet another Viagara induced spasmodic jerky-freak out, I might kick in my television because that is enough to cause birth control for all of Canada!</p>
<p>BUT! that best part is TONIGHT, TONIGHT &#8230; cue them from &#8220;Westside Story&#8221; because I have only two names to drop for you and then you have to wait for tomorrow&#8217;s glorious post: <strong>Johnny Weir skates to Lady Gaga&#8217;s JUST DANCE &#8230; oh yes, I just wrote that! </strong></p>
