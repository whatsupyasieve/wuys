				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Bruins have won 7 in a row</strong>.</p>
<p>We like this.  <strong>We like this alot.</strong></p>
<p><strong>6 wins on the road</strong> including a huge win over the best team in the NHL, the Vancouver Canucks and the Sedin Wonder Twins.</p>
<p>Last time the B&#8217;s won 6 straight on the road was waaaay <strong>back in 1972</strong>.  They won the Cup that year and they had some guy named <strong>Bobby Orr</strong> on the team.</p>
<div style="width: 340px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://www.hockeyhermit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/bobby-orr.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="420" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hockey God.</p></div>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s 2-1 win over <strong>Tampa Bay</strong>, made it 7 Ws in a row for the Killer Bs.  It wasn&#8217;t a pretty win by any means, as the team struggled offensively and turned prime scoring chances in to jack squat.  A missed net here, a clanger off the post there.  Sometimes they didn&#8217;t even take a shot at all.  (I&#8217;m talking to you Nathan Horton.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a cautiously optimistic sports fan.  I don&#8217;t like saying too much or hoping too much on the off-chance that it all comes crashing down around me.</p>
<p>Maybe it is because I&#8217;m a Red Sox fan and we are all too familiar with disappointment.  It took us a long time to get over Buckner.  (18 years)</p>
<div style="width: 370px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" " src="http://www.thesportsbank.net/core/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/buckner.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="360" /><p class="wp-caption-text">*facepalm*</p></div>
<p>But I really <strong>really love this Bruins team</strong>.  Really.  Almost as much as I love my Prada backpack. (TTIHAY reference!)</p>
<p>The Bruins feel like a team that can stay in games even if they are trailing, execute their coach&#8217;s game plan, and remain calm, cool and collected.  They do more good things than bad things and that&#8217;ll win you games very time.</p>
<div style="width: 458px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://www.paisleypetunia.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/a_winner_is_you_1024.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="336" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Winning is awesome.  Just ask Charlie Sheen.</p></div>
<p>This Bruins team has an attitude.  A swagger.  <strong>A blue-collar bravado.</strong></p>
<p>Maybe it has something to do with this&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/blogs/rolling-stone-video-blog/exclusive-the-dropkick-murphys-throw-a-wild-irish-party-in-going-out-in-style-20110301">Orr, Lucic, and Thornton featured in Dropkick Murphys&#8217; new video.  Irish wake + shots of whiskey + hockey players = winning</a>.</p>
<p>What ever the reason, I want more of it.  Much MORE!  Enough to fill the top of that pretty silver bowl&#8230;</p>
