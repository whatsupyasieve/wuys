				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week&#8217;s Foxy Friday is a bit of an unconventional choice but just hear us out.</p>
<p>Back in the 1970s and the time of the Big Bad Bruins, <strong>Derek Sanderson</strong> was the definition of &#8220;Like a Boss.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drove a Rolls Royce, wore mink coats, and flashed diamonds.  He won the Calder Trophy in 1968 and two Stanley Cups with the Bruins.  Cosmopolitan Magazine named him one of the Sexiest Men in America.</p>

<p>The man, also know as &#8220;Turk&#8221;, was hockey rock star in every sense of the word.</p>
<p>But in true rock star fashion, he blew it all away.</p>
<p>An addiction to drugs and alcohol ruined his career and life and by 1978, Sanderson was washed-up and washed-out of hockey.</p>
<p>

			</span>
		</span>
	</p>
<p>Eventually, Sanderson recovered, thanks to help from friend, teammate, and  hockey god Bobby Orr.  He got clean and sober and went on to work as a sportscaster for the Bruins and financial adviser.</p>
<p>And now Turk is going to be a movie star.</p>
<p>Ed Burns and writer-director Doug Atchison are developing a feature film about Sanderson&#8217;s life and times, based on his autobiography<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Line-Derek-Sanderson/dp/1600786804"> &#8220;Crossing the Line&#8221;</a>.  [read more <a href="http://www.boston.com/names/2012/11/12/derek-sanderson-story-readied-for-the-big-screen/GcmhHBMI2BoxwGNy9MaWPI/story.html">here</a>]</p>
<p>So you are probably thinking to yourselves <strong>&#8220;How does THIS guy deserve to be a Foxy Friday? What about his spectacular downward spiral qualifies him to join the illustrious Phi Phi Phi fraternity?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>One word.</p>
<p>Comeback.</p>
<p>Think Britney Spears.  <strong></strong>Think Robert Downey Jr. Think Red Sox in the 2004 ALCS.</p>
<p><strong>Everybody loves a comeback.</strong></p>
<p>Comebacks are foxy.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>P.S.  No word on casting yet but we think <strong>Chris Pine</strong> would be an EXCELLENT choice to play Sanderson.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Last night, I had the time of my life</strong>.</p>
<p>Just like Baby in &#8220;Dirty Dancing.&#8221;  Except <strong>instead of Johnny Castle, I had Tim Thomas</strong>.</p>
<p>Thanks to a one very awesome friend, <strong>I was at Game 4</strong> of the Stanley Cup Finals at TD Garden.</p>
<p>Bruins shutout the Canucks, 4-0  to even the series 2-2.  Series returns to Vancouver for Game 5 on Friday.</p>
<p>Attending the Stanley Cup Finals is a dream for any hockey fan, including me.  It was very high on my bucket list, <strong>right up there with seeing the pyramids and making out with Ben Affleck.</strong></p>
<p>But I never thought that it would <span style="text-decoration:underline;">ACTUALLY</span> happen.</p>
<p>That was until last night.</p>
<p>So how did I get there?  How did I come to check this off my bucket list? And what did it feel like when I did?</p>
<p>See below.<em>..</em></p>
<p><em>[ It&#8217;s sort long but bear with me.  Get it?  Bear.  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ]</em></p>
<p>===============================</p>
<p>I have a friend from high school. <strong> His name is Smitty</strong>.  It&#8217;s really Kevin, but pretty sure that his mom and his wife are the only ones who call him Kevin (but of that I can&#8217;t really be sure).  Smitty is a high school teacher and hockey coach and like me, a life long Bruin fan, and fan of the sport in general.</p>
<p>The man had a<strong> Stanley Cup groom&#8217;s cake at his wedding</strong>. Clearly, this man is our hero.</p>

	</a><p class="wp-caption-text">Cue me, freaking out.</p></div>
<p>I message him back immediately.</p>
<p><strong>My response reads something like: &#8220;COUNT ME IN!  Holy #@%*.  I love you!  How much are the tickets?  Oh really?  That much?  Whatever.  That&#8217;s cool.  I&#8217;ll just eat ramen for a month.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>I get all light-headed.  Have to sit down.  *deep breath*</p>
<p>Wednesdays are grad school days for me, but fortunately my professor is a sports psychologist and hockey fan, so he was very understanding when I told him I had to leave early because I was going to Game 4.</p>
<p>As I make my way down Canal Street to the Garden, I am engulfed in a sea of black and gold&#8230;with bit of white and blue mixed in.</p>
<p><strong>Brave orcas.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The closer I get to the Garden, the more my heart starts to flutter. </strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m really here.</p>
<p>This is really happening.</p>
<p>Before heading to our seats (in Club Section 145, no less), quick stop is made at the Bruins Pro Shop.  One must mark this occasion with SCF accoutrements, including a t-shirt and banner.</p>
<p>Now, my office looks even better.</p>

<p>The Stanley Cup Finals are a special sporting event, but it takes on a whole new meaning and significance when your team are the ones playing for it.</p>
<p>From warm-ups to the announcement of the Three Stars, the atmosphere in the Garden was super-charged, like a summer thunderstorm.</p>
<p>Every single person in that arena was sending out the most positive beautiful energy that it is hard to believe how the players couldn&#8217;t feel it seeping through the walls into the locker room.</p>
<p>Every time Nathan Horton&#8217;s name was mentioned or they showed a fan wearing his jersey, the crowd erupted in cheers and applause.  In only his first season as a Bruin, NH18 has made his mark as a fan favorite and the outpouring of love from the Black and Gold faithful has to help speed up his recover.</p>
<p>Bruins legend Bobby Orr (#4) was the honorary flag bearer for the start of the game.  Fittingly, <strong>he waved Horton&#8217;s flag</strong>, as a salute to the injured Bruins forward.</p>
<p>Genius move, Bruins.  Way to lift the crowd to an <strong>whole other level of controlled frenzy</strong>.</p>
<p><em>(Sidenote: Bobby Orr is like 65, but he is still WAY hot.)</em></p>

<p>The game itself was everything that one could hope for in a SCF game&#8230;unless you are a Canucks fan.  The Green Men were very sad.</p>
<p>The Bruins were dominant, controlled, quick to the puck.</p>
<p>Their penalty kill continues to shine (21 for 22 in this series).</p>
<p>Bruins D-fence remains dominant in shutting down Vancouver&#8217;s offensive threats. I think it is because of <strong>Adam McQuaid&#8217;s mullet</strong>.  That thing is <strong>glorious and magical</strong>.</p>

<p>Going to a Stanley Cup Finals game is a once in a lifetime experience but to be able to experience it with your hometown team, on home ice, is <strong>something entirely transcendental</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>It leaves you with a feeling of elation.  Of glee.  Of passion. Of adoration.  Of worship.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>And most of all, of pride.  </strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Bruins have won 7 in a row</strong>.</p>
<p>We like this.  <strong>We like this alot.</strong></p>
<p><strong>6 wins on the road</strong> including a huge win over the best team in the NHL, the Vancouver Canucks and the Sedin Wonder Twins.</p>
<p>Last time the B&#8217;s won 6 straight on the road was waaaay <strong>back in 1972</strong>.  They won the Cup that year and they had some guy named <strong>Bobby Orr</strong> on the team.</p>
<div style="width: 340px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://www.hockeyhermit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/bobby-orr.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="420" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hockey God.</p></div>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s 2-1 win over <strong>Tampa Bay</strong>, made it 7 Ws in a row for the Killer Bs.  It wasn&#8217;t a pretty win by any means, as the team struggled offensively and turned prime scoring chances in to jack squat.  A missed net here, a clanger off the post there.  Sometimes they didn&#8217;t even take a shot at all.  (I&#8217;m talking to you Nathan Horton.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a cautiously optimistic sports fan.  I don&#8217;t like saying too much or hoping too much on the off-chance that it all comes crashing down around me.</p>
<p>Maybe it is because I&#8217;m a Red Sox fan and we are all too familiar with disappointment.  It took us a long time to get over Buckner.  (18 years)</p>
<div style="width: 370px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" " src="http://www.thesportsbank.net/core/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/buckner.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="360" /><p class="wp-caption-text">*facepalm*</p></div>
<p>But I really <strong>really love this Bruins team</strong>.  Really.  Almost as much as I love my Prada backpack. (TTIHAY reference!)</p>
<p>The Bruins feel like a team that can stay in games even if they are trailing, execute their coach&#8217;s game plan, and remain calm, cool and collected.  They do more good things than bad things and that&#8217;ll win you games very time.</p>
<div style="width: 458px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://www.paisleypetunia.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/a_winner_is_you_1024.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="336" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Winning is awesome.  Just ask Charlie Sheen.</p></div>
<p>This Bruins team has an attitude.  A swagger.  <strong>A blue-collar bravado.</strong></p>
<p>Maybe it has something to do with this&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/blogs/rolling-stone-video-blog/exclusive-the-dropkick-murphys-throw-a-wild-irish-party-in-going-out-in-style-20110301">Orr, Lucic, and Thornton featured in Dropkick Murphys&#8217; new video.  Irish wake + shots of whiskey + hockey players = winning</a>.</p>
<p>What ever the reason, I want more of it.  Much MORE!  Enough to fill the top of that pretty silver bowl&#8230;</p>
