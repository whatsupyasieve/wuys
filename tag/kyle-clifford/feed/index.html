Brown went out for a bit with a sore ouchie. (not minimizing his pain, just borrowing BB&#8217;s explanation for hockey player&#8217;s injuries) The only bright spot was an interview with Kopitar from the sidelines with Heidi Androl still trying to hit that! I think he might be that the last King&#8217;s hold out she hasn&#8217;t hit.</p>
<p>With a little over three minutes left in the game, tempers flared. Clifford cross-checks Teemu and Teemu returns the favor with a nasty elbow to the face and then Teemu gets double teamed with Richardson coming in on him. Brookbank takes Clifford and then Teemu squares off with Richardson.</p>
<p>While I do love Teemu (obviously) I don&#8217;t want any of my boys having to face him in the play-offs. He is still too dangerous.</p>

<p>Not bad for the Foxy-Forty-Finnish-Flash in his final regulation free-way face-off finishing with a flashy fight!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I just finished watching my Kings spank the Bruins, sorry Chuck. I sent you a text. Touched by God had an assist and it was a shut out &#8211; 2-0 on Timmy the Tank &#8211; not since 2000 have the Kings blanked the Bruins and they have beat the Bruins the last 5 times &#8211; yay Kings! Awesome fight below.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/7yB0copGszQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>But riddle me this Batman &#8211; because this is not the first time I&#8217;ve had to yell at the TV at an NHL team. Why on earth, when they are winning, do they go into the same stupid thing. I see this in football too and for lack of a better explanation, I can only call it &#8216;prevent defense&#8217;. They&#8217;ve been grinding it out in the opposition&#8217;s end for the first 2 and 2/3&#8217;s of the game  which is <strong>WHY THEY ARE WINNING IN THE FIRST PLACE </strong>and then all of a sudden, they just fall back and start chipping it back and allow the other team to hang out in their end and almost ALWAYS end up either losing the game or ALMOST losing the game. <strong>I DO NOT UNDERSTAND</strong>. Why change strategy when the first one was working for you?</p>
<div id="attachment_2551" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/cartman_kings-b1.jpg"><img src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/cartman_kings-b1.jpg?w=300" alt="" title="cartman_kings-b[1]" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-2551" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/cartman_kings-b1.jpg 640w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/cartman_kings-b1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">respect my authoritee!</p></div>
<p>OK, I know I am not an NHL coach but if any one has a legitimate coherent answer to this question, I&#8217;d really love to hear it because I seriously, do not understand WHY. The Kings almost lost the game switching to this idiotic strategy. I didn&#8217;t understand it when I watched football with my Dad and I don&#8217;t understand it now seeing it in hockey. It&#8217;s just plain lame.</p>
