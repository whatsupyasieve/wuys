<p>It turns out I really miss those.</p>
<p>The NHL handed out their awards over the weekend while I had no internet and no idea it was happening.  Oh well.  My campaign for a &#8220;make up for the lockout and no All-Star Game&#8221; program involving a swimsuit competition and push-up contest apparently fell on deaf ears.</p>

	<em>Is that a tray of watches and potato pancakes?</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Mmmmmkay.  I would have gone with Crosby, but research indicates I may be biased.  Can you miss 1/4 of 1/2 of a season and still be MVP?  Fine, I guess not &#8211; but Sid only lost <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nhl/blog/eye-on-hockey/22432048/nhl-awards-alex-ovechkin-wins-third-hart-trophy-as-mvp">by 4 votes</a>.  I did admit this was the first year I have appreciated Ovi.  If this award inspires him to play like his three Hart-worthy seasons (instead of last season!) in the future, it&#8217;s cool by me.</p>
<p>John Tavares, what do you think?</p>

<p><strong>Selke/Best Defensive Forward &#8211; Jonathan Toews</strong></p>

<p>Approved.  Chuck would say Bergy but with the season the Hawks had, seeing one of their lead offensive players (T-1st in team goals, 2nd in points) also be their best defensive forward is especially impressive.  Why work that hard when you&#8217;re winning all the time anyway?  Because it&#8217;s a huge part of how you win all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Lady Byng/Sportsmanship &#8211; Marty St. Louis</strong></p>

<p>HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SQUISHY!!  He&#8217;s 38 today.  It&#8217;s easy to assume Squishy wins this award (almost) every year because he&#8217;s small.  Not true.  Brad Marchand is small.  You with me?  St. Louis also lead the NHL in points &#8211; at 37, he was the oldest player to ever do this.  Score that much and be nice about it? Our moms are so proud.</p>

<p>In a world where Bobrovsky was traded and now the Flyers will buyout Bryzgalov&#8217;s monster contract, are you laughing a little?  I&#8217;m laughing.  I also applaud Bob&#8217;s gutsy choice of suit and tie.  Gotta be sauve when you&#8217;re up against King Henrik.</p>
<p><strong>Norris/Best Defenseman &#8211; PK Subban</strong></p>

<p>I know voting only takes regular season into account, but if this went to Kris Letang after the Pens&#8217; playoffs even I would have been ashamed.  Maybe next year, Tanger.  Maybe you need a ponytail holder.  I don&#8217;t like Subban but I&#8217;d like him if he were on my team.  <a href="http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/console?catid=53&amp;id=185521">All those chin-ups</a> with the 100 lb. of extra weight have paid off.</p>

<p>I saw maybe 3 Panthers games all year and Huberdeau scored in all of them so I&#8217;m on board with this.  Jon also has the appropriately wry jawline and poufy hair potential to replace Matt Smith as <em>Doctor Who</em>, if they could tape only in summer.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay/Most Outstanding Player (by NHLPA) &#8211; Sidney Crosby</strong></p>

<p>Being voted Most Outstanding by fellow players in pretty great.  Sid would rather have the Cup, the Richard, the Hart&#8230; but this award <em>is</em> this season for Sid, especially with his injury.  I&#8217;m not going to gush.  Just sum up my feelings with the time Sid went to a Justin Beiber concert in the same week I went to a Justin Beiber concert.  I love everything.  Hold it together, girls.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m talking about the <strong>Philadelphia Flyers and goaltending</strong>.</p>
<p>For years now, the Flyers organization have had issues  finding just the right goalie to lead them to the Stanley Cup.  They came close in 2010 behind the tandem of Brian &#8220;Bobby&#8221; Boucher and Michael Leighton, but it just wasn&#8217;t enough. The team has lacked that netminder who brings consistency to the starting goaltender position and who hold on to the starting position for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>If the Bruins Stanley Cup run has shown us anything, it is that in order to win the Cup, you need to have goaltending. Tim Thomas was otherworldly last season and it is his stellar play along with the play of the entire team that brought them the ultimate hockey prize.</p>
<p>Any hockey fan can recognize that the Flyers are talented.  <strong>Claude Gingeroux</strong> might be one of the best young players in the NHL.  They have a solid core of young talent mixed in with veterans like <strong>Scott Hartnell, Danny Briere,</strong> and future NHL Hall of Famer <strong>Jaromir Jagr</strong>.  Coach <strong>Peter Laviolette</strong> has won a Cup before with the Hurricanes, so he&#8217;s proven that he can take a team all the way.  </p>
<p>I truly believe that the Flyers thought that bringing in<strong> Ilya Bryzgalov</strong> would solve their twine troubles.   He won the Cup in 2007 with the Ducks.  He is a 3-time Olympian, has won numerous international medals, was the runner-up for the Vezina Trophy and a top 5 finalist for the Hart Trophy in 2010.  He is, by all accounts, a top-flight NHL Goalie.</p>

	</a></p>
<p>Flyers spend a pretty penny on signing Bryz in the off-season, to a <strong>nine-year,$51 million dollar contract</strong>.  The team believed in Bryz so much that they even went as far as to pull off two high-profile trades before the signing was announced in order to make room for him under the salary cap &#8211; <strong>Jeff Carter to Columbus</strong> and captain <strong>Mike Richards to Los Angeles</strong>.  Granted Flyers did receive some great young talent like Jakub Voraceck, Wayne Simmonds, and Brayden Schenn, and a grip of draft picks in return, but was it really all worth it?  Have the Flyers really gotten what they&#8217;ve so desperately desired?</p>
<p>Some might say yes, while others will lament that the Flyers made a terrible mistake. At yesterday&#8217;s Winter Classic, a marquee NHL event, you expect to see your #1 goalie on the ice.   Bryz rode the bench.   The Flyers&#8217; other netminder, Sergei &#8220;Bob&#8221; Bobrovsky got the start. Probably not a terrible idea to go with Bob over Byrz since he&#8217;s been winless in his last four starts, going 0-3 and giving up 16 goals on 87 shots and Bobrovsky is 3-0 in his last three starts, giving up 6 goals on 88 shots.  </p>
<p>But it really didn&#8217;t matter who started.  <strong>Flyers lost anyway.</strong></p>
<p>While the season is still a long way from over, it seems that despite the organization&#8217;s best efforts, the Flyers&#8217; goaltending conundrum continues. </p>
<p><strong>Now, by no means, do I actually<em> want</em> the Flyers to win.</strong>    As a Bruins fan, it is not in my DNA to allow that.  But I am a hockey fan and I appreciate the struggle and desires of players and fans, and the hope an entire city places in 20 men on their quest to obtain the pinnacle of hockey supremacy.</p>
