<p>Ovi has a new commercial for CCM skates and I LOVE IT! Although he can&#8217;t act and is laughing through out when he is supposed to be a total A**, he is just too adorable and shows he can make fun of himself and the image MAX TALBOT likes to refer to!<br />
<div id="attachment_473" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/aags1311.jpg"><img src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/aags1311.jpg?w=240" alt="" title="AAGS131" width="240" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-473" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/aags1311.jpg 340w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/aags1311-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Gee Dad, when's curfew?

And in other news just for Pants, Sidney Crosby may just be ready to FINALLY move out of Mario Lemieux&#8217;s home after living there for, oh, 6 years! Seriously, he has lived with Mario since he signed with the Pens. But he says that although his house is almost ready, he is not going to make any rash decisions about moving out too fast. Hummm &#8230;. 23 years old and basically still living at home. Sounds like a prize! It&#8217;s not like he moved to America and doesn&#8217;t know the language or anything &#8230; Like Ovi &#8230; Or is Canadian speak that much different or harder than Russian?</p>
<p>You decide &#8211; heh? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
