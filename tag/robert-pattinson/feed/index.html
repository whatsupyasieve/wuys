				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada should just rename this &#8220;The Jeremy Roenick Show&#8221; because he is the only reason to watch. While it was Halloween, Jeremy showed up as a &#8216;vampire/frankenstein&#8217; which really looked like he was in drag which really looked like just another excuse for him to wear women&#8217;s underwear and grinned like he had a secret that we all really knew anyway but were just humoring him. Of course the usual jokes ensued about it being JR&#8217;s normal face etc. ha ha ha &#8211; NOT.</p>

	</a><p class="wp-caption-text">Just another day for JR!</p></div>Curtis Joseph was the guest judge. Wait for it &#8230; yes, another sad attempt for Halloween humor from our friends up north &#8211; Cujo &#8211; get it, Stephen King &#8211; Cujo &#8211; Guest Judge &#8211; Halloween &#8211; Scary &#8211; Get it? Am I done? <strong>No, I wish I was because we should have turned this into a drinking contest for every time they mentioned this and JR&#8217;s face in this hour program </strong>&#8211; Now THAT would have been fun! Mr. Cherrie and I do that when we watch Capital Games and they mention the Hershey Bears.</p>
<p>Yes, you may have noticed I haven&#8217;t even mentioned any of the skating programs, that&#8217;s because they all pretty much sucked, and not in the cool, vampire, sexy &#8211; I heart Robert Pattinson &#8211; I want him to bite me &#8211; kind of way. They sucked in the &#8211; that is why they were voted off and should no longer be participating &#8211; I want to stab myself multiple times to make the pain of watching this bearable &#8211; I wish I was watching anything else &#8211; even that sucky &#8211; Vampires Suck- movie kind of way.</p>

<p>So I will stake this post and show more mercy than I received having to wade through this nightmare and tell you that the worst possible out come happened: Patrice &#8211; I have absolutely no personality &#8211; and his skating skank Shae Lynn who were voted off last week &#8211; were re-instated and will be back to terrorize BOTB next week. *SIGH* Which was truly the most terrifying thing that happened.</p>
