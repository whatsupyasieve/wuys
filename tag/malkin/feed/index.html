The Penguins had their annual Pens and Pins Charity Bowling event on 1/17 and either Malkin and Crosby have been seeing a faith healer or something is rotten in Pittsburg. Not to taint my love for all things Letang because he is still smokin&#8217; hot as evidenced above but for realsies? This is one of the many reasons I can&#8217;t stand Sidney. <strong>If he can attend a Pens&#8217; Charity event, he can damn well at least attend the All-Star game. He owes it to the fans.</strong></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2582" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/jjs_6859_slide1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2582" title="JJS_6859_slide[1]" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/jjs_6859_slide1.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="289" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/jjs_6859_slide1.jpg 560w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/jjs_6859_slide1-300x289.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">ignore the princess on the left - fleury is adorable!</p></div>As far as  Malkin goes, if he can bowl, I&#8217;m not seeing anything wrong with his knee. Again, he can get his Russian hockey butt to the All-Star game too if only to attend for the fans. <strong>UPDATE: Evidently now Bylsma is claiming Malkin has a sinus infection/illness and won&#8217;t be attending and will not be playing in tonight&#8217;s game either. </strong></p>
<p>I think Geno and Crosby should just come clean like Zetterburg and Luongo and say, &#8220;I just don&#8217;t want to attend. Thanks but no thanks .&#8221;  Which leads to a whole other discussion, should there be an All-Star game? Because with the All-Stars dropping like flies &#8211; what does that say to us fans? It sorts feels like the ultimate F-You &#8211;  D-listed like the entertainment. Dissed and disrepected.</p>

It was a Staal-on-Staal-fest with Jordan coming out on top with a 3-2 win. But that wasn&#8217;t who I was watching.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2520" style="width: 242px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/108252480_slide1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2520" title="108252480_slide[1]" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/108252480_slide1.jpg?w=232" alt="" width="232" height="300" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/108252480_slide1.jpg 419w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/108252480_slide1-232x300.jpg 232w" sizes="(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">lights, camera ... ACTION!</p></div>On a side note, pick up this weeks edition of <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1180919/index.htm">S.I.</a> because once in a blue moon, they actually cover hockey! And this weekend, you guessed it, KRIS LETANG! He and I have something else in common other than being southpaws, he suffers from congenital migraines. <strong>And let me tell you, I can imagine what it&#8217;s like.</strong> He slept at the rink rather than drove home one night because he ran out of pills. It happens folks. Ask why or how he still plays with mind crushing pain? Or you feel like the dude in Scanners? When he can&#8217;t see the puck or someone about to plaster him against the boards? When you want something so bad, you just do it. You make it happen. You put it all aside. What a trooper! I hope he finds a good combination of therapy that helps him get them under control because they are a bitch!</p>
