				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So the rumor mill has cranked back up again and supposedly Jarome Iginla and Miikka Kiprusoff are back on the auction block even though, like a fat chick loves cup cakes &#8211; well let&#8217;s be honest we ALL LOVE those sweet delicious treats, Calgary keeps saying &#8220;No, No. No.&#8221; But media speculation is high as the trade deadline nears and those in the know say all the other tweaks that Calgary has tried hasn&#8217;t worked, it&#8217;s cut bait time. The only thing left for Calgary to do is auction their biggest assets off to the highest bidders while they are still hot and rebuild.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2337" style="width: 307px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/jarome_mmx-thumb-297x2231.jpg">

	</a><p class="wp-caption-text">class and hotness= love!</p></div>I have totes mixed feelings about this as Calgary has been my &#8216;other&#8217; boyfriend for many years. And Nomie and Kippy are my boys. While I&#8217;d hate to see them leave, if they stay, they&#8217;ll never see Lord Stanley &#8211; and I mean Stanley cup, not STAN LEE. One rumor that persists is Nomie going to the LA Kings and I think we all know how I&#8217;d feel about THAT! <strong>Anyone for a &#8216;Touched by God&#8217; and Nomie sandwich? I&#8217;d take 10 please!</strong></p>
<p>As for Kippy-Pants, in my world, it all goes back to the Caps. I hope to all that is holy in Hockey, Teddy-boy is burning up the phone lines to Calgary. If Kippy is available, he&#8217;s PERFECT because <strong>THEY NEED A GOALIE. </strong>Sorry Neuvy sweetie &#8211; but you would sky-rocket if Kippy was your mentor. Then I would wish Varly on the Penguins! HA! No, I heart Fleury too much. He could go to Vancouver or back to the KHL. I really don&#8217;t care.</p>
<p>So we shall see if Calgary is going to make a big move. Because Iginla and  Kiprusoff both have no-trade clauses but once you waive it, it&#8217;s gone and the next team is free to trade you off if you don&#8217;t produce. Totes suckiness. So they&#8217;d have to agree and both have publicly stated they are not moving but the PTB say this is just to deflect the constant press pressure. Only time will tell.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2338" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/392-kiprusoff0803121.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2338" title="392-kiprusoff080312[1]" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/392-kiprusoff0803121.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="176" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/392-kiprusoff0803121.jpg 392w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/392-kiprusoff0803121-300x176.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Pst ... Dawn wants you in Washington to Win a Cup!</p></div><strong>Lastly, a Sidney Crosby update &#8211; JUST FOR PANTS.</strong> According the Hot Stove on HNIC Saturday, they talked to Sid&#8217;s manager because the Pens weren&#8217;t talking &#8216;aboot&#8217; his status. He is <strong>STILL day to day </strong>because he&#8217;s not good. He wakes up fuzzy, he&#8217;s clear for 5-6 hours and then crashes. <strong>NOT GOOD. Sorry Sid. We hope you get better &#8211; from everyone here at WUYS. </strong></p>

I was feeling like the only LA King&#8217;s fan in the WORLD and I may still be. But HNIC&#8217;s big game this weekend was Edmonton VS LA KING&#8217;s and not only were we treated to a special highlight of LA KINGS Legendary Goalie Rogie Vachon, it was basically a <strong>DREW DOUGHTY LOVE-FEST! ALL OF CANADA</strong>, or at least all the staff at HNIC is in love with DREW &#8216;TOUCHED BY GOD&#8217; DOUGHTY. While the Washington Capitals have the Ovechcam, a camera solely focused on everything Ovechkin &#8211; total GOLD &#8211; this game had a <strong>DREW DOUGHTY-CAM</strong>.</p>

He also got the first star of the game, had his third goal of the season, a crushing hip check on Taylor Hall which led to yet another interview, with Taylor Hall &#8211; ABOUT DREW &#8216;TOUCHED BY GOD&#8217; DOUGHTY! and a huge dog pile on Drew, (he&#8217;s at the bottom of this pile) which he took like a man and came out smelling like a rose!</p>

<p>All and all, one of the BEST HNIC ALL YEAR! Also because LA won! Of course, until NEXT WEEK when the Capitals take Toronto! They love to hate Ovi! But last time Ovi was on HNIC they all but creamed their pants over him so can&#8217;t wait for that one. THAT WILL BE A SHOW. Two weeks in a row &#8230; GOD BLESS CANADA and HNIC! The Great Grapes will gripe and groan and Ovi will love it all! Whether he scores or not, Ovi always puts on a show for them. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You remember in the 80&#8217;s when TV writers didn&#8217;t know how to end the big cliff hanger episode on Dallas or Moonlighting so they did the Ol&#8217; have Maddy and Bruce get together &#8211; something you&#8217;ve been waiting for, like forevs, only to be sucker punched like Avery, to find out Maddy was having a bad case of od&#8217;ing on Midol and it was all a PMS dream? Well welcome to this week&#8217;s episode of BOTB!</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1331" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/hookup-moonlighting1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1331" title="hookup-moonlighting[1]" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/hookup-moonlighting1.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="192" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/hookup-moonlighting1.jpg 524w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/hookup-moonlighting1-300x192.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Back when Bruce was hot.</p></div>It opened with Kurt teaching Ron how to figure skate &#8230; yes, you heard me. Talk about being a toe pick tease. Kurt even made a reference about Ron &#8216;coming out of the figure skating closet&#8217;. I&#8217;m telling you, I had my popcorn ready for a full on make out session &#8211; but no. After weeks of being teased, it STILL DIDN&#8217;T HAPPEN. You know why? Because Ron&#8217;s real life metro-sexual life partner was this week&#8217;s guest judge &#8211; MY HOCKEY HUSBAND &#8211; the great DONALD S. CHERRY &#8211; let the true goo-goo eyes begin as Ron breathlessly whispers &#8216;Grapes&#8217; and all sorts other sweet nicknames they must call each in the throes of passion between HNIC commercial breaks.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1329" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/doncherryhnic200805311.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1329" title="doncherryhnic20080531[1]" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/doncherryhnic200805311.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/doncherryhnic200805311.jpg 768w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/doncherryhnic200805311-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Grapes and Ronny-Poo</p></div>But the REAL hilarity ensued with the super-sweet flashback to JR&#8217;s &#8216;childhood&#8217; when Grapes and Ronny-poo visited JR&#8217;s parents 20 years ago to watch JR play in the Stanley cup finals at their house. With JR&#8217;s adorable Dad in his red sweat pants showing Grapes JR&#8217;s various trophies. Grapes has to comment about how &#8220;That&#8217;s not a very big trophy for being the highest scorer.&#8221; Really Grapes? Is Ron&#8217;s &#8216;trophy&#8217; bigger? You realize JR was just a kid? Is that legal in Canada? You know, for an old man you only played <strong>ONE GAME IN THE NHL.</strong> He is really an ASS &#8211; you heard me. Many people do not realize this old goat only played <strong>ONE GAME IN THE NHL.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, fast forward to JR cowering in the corner  like he just had a really bad acid flash back or was banging his head against the table while that video was being shown. Not sure which or maybe it was both. May explain a little more about JR. Now mind you, this all happened before the first commercial break!</p>
<p>It was &#8220;Men&#8217;s night&#8221;. Yes, and don&#8217;t ask me to explain because I still have no real idea what that meant except that each dude had to skate for 30 seconds solo. For Ron and Grapes, I imagine that is too long for either of them at their age to sustain anything and I will just leave it at that.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1327" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/toddrotatorwk7-thumb-620xauto-599621.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1327" title="toddrotatorwk7-thumb-620xauto-59962[1]" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/toddrotatorwk7-thumb-620xauto-599621.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="170" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/toddrotatorwk7-thumb-620xauto-599621.jpg 620w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/toddrotatorwk7-thumb-620xauto-599621-300x170.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I am Man.. hear me roar.</p></div>So how was the skating? Well, Patrice the boring frenchman tripped several times and yet, the judges gave him a pass. Kelly actually manage to pull off something that resembled skating for once and instead of viagra induced fist pumps, we got finger stabbing at the camera. Todd is looking more and more like Cesare Romero from the original BATMAN TV series and his skating was blah. Val, oh Val. He had a very small fall. Not at all as noticeable as the tripping frenchman but again, because Canadians hate Russians, he was severely punished and slammed for it. Grapes even makes a comment about not knowing that Russians could be &#8216;that good in the corners&#8217; and starts rambling on about how much better Val&#8217;s brother was than him and too bad he&#8217;s retired because Calgary could use him now. WOW! I bet the Sutter brothers are happy about that slam on national TV!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1336" style="width: 239px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/819494331.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1336" title="81949433[1]" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/819494331.jpg?w=229" alt="" width="229" height="300" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/819494331.jpg 455w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/819494331-229x300.jpg 229w" sizes="(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hey Calgary, I&#039;m hot and available and good in the corners!</p></div>Thank God as I mentioned it was all a bad dream because even though ValKat was in the skate off against Kelly, they will be in the FINALLY next week. And yes, I misspelled that on purpose.</p>
