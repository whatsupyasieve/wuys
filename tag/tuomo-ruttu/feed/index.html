<p>Well Intern Jeff Skinner set his dimples to stun on Saturday night and had <strong>3 points against the Penguins</strong>.  If I didn&#8217;t love him, I&#8217;d hate him.  He scored a scrappy little backhand lifter, then served up a pass to Tuomo Ruuto that was almost as cute as he is.  The third point was sheer determination &#8211; look at him trying to go through Nisky! &#8211; he would have scored it himself in another second.  <strong>Finns &amp; Skinns</strong>, they are called.  So much cute.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jeff leads his team with 7 G/10 A and 2 game-winning goals.</p>
<p>The Canes were 2-8 for their last 10 games and EStaal was having a very rough go of it.  He hadn&#8217;t scored in 10 games and was -16.  Saturday he moved to wing, off his usual center position, to shake things up and it worked:  EStaal had an assist and the GWG.  He&#8217;s still -17, but it&#8217;s a start.  Best part? <strong> He watched Skinns to learn!</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;I felt OK on the wing,&#8221; said Staal after the game. &#8220;It was a little bit of an adjustment, but watching [Jeff] Skinner a little bit in the first and second, I kind of figured it out in the third.&#8221;</em> [<a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/content/playerpages/playerbreakingnews.asp?sport=NHL&amp;id=1642&amp;line=143865&amp;spln=1">link</a>]</p>

<p>So while I never want the Pens to lose, I felt a little okay about this one.  The Canes really needed it.  Maybe it was the crap-tastic Capitals game we were at while this unfolded &#8211; at least the Pens were trying.</p>
