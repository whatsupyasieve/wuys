	</a><p class="wp-caption-text">let&#039;s hear it for Seattle!</p></div>But this is aboot <em><strong>OUR</strong></em> Mr. Brooksy. Our unsung Mr. Brooks whom I must brag that Mr. Cherrie and his Puck Bunny Posse used to watch play as a Foxy Cublet here in Seattle <strong>as a Seattle Thunderbird</strong>. What&#8217;s that you say? It&#8217;s a WHL team. He credits getting traded to Seattle as one of the best things that happened to his career. What? Here? OK. If you say so. I went to one or two games with Mr. Cherrie in that time period so I guess I can say I probably saw Brooks play but I honestly don&#8217;t remember. It wasn&#8217;t his fault, it would be mine. I didn&#8217;t care at the time. I KNOW. SACRILEGE. BURN ME AT THE STAKE. But the jokes on me now &#8211; isn&#8217;t it?</p>

	</a><p class="wp-caption-text">I am not laughing at that shirt?</p></div>He made it to the big time and I&#8217;m still in Seattle &#8211; watching Mr. Laich on Center Ice rather than at Key Arena or way down in Kent! Yuck! Don&#8217;t even ask. But I&#8217;m glad one of ours made it big. And made it big on a team I LIKE! That&#8217;s even hotter! <strong>That&#8217;s almost like two degrees of separation above. Me &#8211; Brooks &#8211; Ovi.</strong></p>
<p><div id="attachment_3404" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/pantry1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3404" title="pantry[1]" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/pantry1.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="154" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/pantry1.jpg 482w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/pantry1-300x154.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">he&#039;s a bit of a neat freak so don&#039;t mess with his cupboard</p></div>He didn&#8217;t go big in the draft. He&#8217;s worked his way up. It&#8217;s been a long road. And he is still developing. He&#8217;s a blue-collar hockey man, much like the fans. He knows where he&#8217;s been. He knows where he wants to be. He knows how to get there and isn&#8217;t afraid of the hard work it takes to get there.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re wondering why Brooks keeps his hair cropped, don&#8217;t. <strong>He would put Mike Green to SHAME. Seriously.</strong> And if you&#8217;re wondering why Brooks is single? He is in a bromance with the entire team. Seriously. His O.C.D. is so O.O.C. &#8220;If I asked you about your family, you would talk about them forever because it&#8217;s something you love. That&#8217;s the way I feel about this team. This team is my life, and I love playing here and I&#8217;m passionate about playing hockey. So it&#8217;s easy for me to talk about it.&#8221; Enough said.</p>

<p>The incident below I think best sums up our Foxy Friday Man and mind you, he was in his suit and it was pouring rain as well, which they neglect to mention in this version:</p>

	</a><p class="wp-caption-text">I do brakes and muffs too.</p></div>Laich received national media attention when he stopped to help two stranded Capitals fans change their flat tire after a Game 7 loss in the 2010 NHL playoffs. When he came across the woman and her teenaged daughter stranded on the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge, Laich stopped to install their spare and apologized for the club&#8217;s early loss in the playoffs. When asked about the incident, Laich responded &#8220;It&#8217;s not a big deal. It was just a tire. The lady was stranded on the side of the road, I saw that it was just a lady and her daughter, and I figured my tire expertise outweighed hers.&#8221;</p>

I got left with cold coffee, stale do-nots and a post-it note from Pants saying &#8220;MM please&#8221;. I am assuming that means I&#8217;m left with Mikey Monday.

I got left with cold coffee, stale do-nots and a post-it note from Pants saying &#8220;MM please&#8221;. I am assuming that means I&#8217;m left with Mikey Monday. God knows he didn&#8217;t do anything last night in the game to scream about except get plastered against the glass from <a href="http://video.capitals.nhl.com/videocenter/console?hlg=20102011,2,672&amp;amp;event=WSH543&amp;amp;fr=false">Nick Foligno.</a></p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve spent the last hour watching paint dry and picking my toe nails but then I found this suspicious little nugget on youtube and if I didn&#8217;t know any better, I swear it sounds like Pants and Chuck disguising their voices. Note the odd change in pitch? And you can&#8217;t see their faces. They are certainly stalkers. They are both on the East coast right now. And they are congratulating him on his win LAST NIGHT. hum&#8230;. I don&#8217;t think it takes Sherlock Holmes to figure this one out. But one of you needs to shave your legs. I&#8217;m just saying!</p>
