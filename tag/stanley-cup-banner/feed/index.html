<p>The Los Angeles Kings will FINALLY get to raise their Stanley Cup banner tonight and WUYS West Coast Correspondent, Aaron is hella excited about it.</p>
<p>Check out his post below&#8230;</p>
<hr />
<p>So here we stand, about to embark on a far too short, forty-eight game NHL season.</p>
<p>Man, it sucks to get short-shrifted on our hockey this year, but I’d be lying if I didn’t say that raising a certain piece of synthetic fabric to the rafters of Staples Center wasn’t going to soften the blow.</p>
<p>On Saturday, January 19<sup>th</sup> at 12 p.m. on the “best” coast (sorry Chuck &amp; Pants), the Los Angeles Kings will raise their first “Stanley Cup Champions” banner in their forty-four year franchise’s history. Worth. Every. Agonizing. Moment.</p>

<p>I’ve seen it all as a Kings fan.</p>
<p>And having witnessed the good, bad, and the oh-so-very ugly of being a Kings fan over the last twenty-five years, it’ll all be worth it, watching that banner get raised, tears streaming down my face like a toddler with a skinned knee.</p>
<p>That’s okay though, I will sob proudly, because this isn’t a moment you get to experience very often.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that the Kings organization chose not to mount the banner on the wall of the Staples Center, because, well, a certain NBA team was kind of hogging it.</p>

<p>So instead, the banner will be the first to actually hang from the rafters of Staples, which symbolizes more than a lack of real estate on the wall.</p>
<p>It symbolizes that Tim Lieweke and the Kings organization want to leave plenty of room for future banners. Lieweke and GM Dean Lombardi built this team from the ground up with the hope of not winning one Stanley Cup, but creating a dynasty.</p>

<p>Seems like a smooth transition into the Kings chances of repeating. Now, it’s no secret there hasn’t been a team to repeat as Stanley Cup champions for fifteen years [1998 Detroit Red Wings.] Bottom line, it’s hard as hell to repeat.</p>
<p>But, and at the risk of sounding like a total “homer,” I think the Kings are poised to be the first team break the fifteen year drought.</p>
<p>Everyone is quick to point out the infamous Stanley Cup hangover – where the team that won the Cup struggles the following season do to an exhausting schedule of parading the Cup around all summer all the while trying to recover from injuries sustained during the elongated playoff run.</p>
<p>Well, considering the Kings have had an extra few months to recuperate, it’s like they ordered Grey Goose instead of the well crap and will wake up on opening day with no headache or vomiting, ready for the puck to drop.</p>

<p>The Kings are also the first team in recent memory to bring back their entire Stanley Cup winning roster.</p>
<p>Lucky for the Kings, there were no aging veterans, no pending free agents looking to get overpaid, and no fat to trim.</p>
<p>Being able to maintain that same chemistry and not having to learn to gel with new teammates is huge advantage for a team looking to repeat as Cup champs.</p>
<p>I’m not calling my shot, just saying that the Kings have a better shot than teams in recent past.</p>
<p>Finally, as the various sports news outlets put out their preseason team rankings, TSN has the Kings ranked at number ten.</p>

<p>My initial feeling upon reading that was <strong>blasphemy</strong>.</p>
<p>After all, how could you possibly rank <strong>nine teams above</strong> the Stanley Cup winners?</p>
<p>After I stopped my combination of yelling and crying however, I realized that this is right where the Kings want to be.</p>
<p>Flying under the radar, no expectations, doing just well enough to hang around.</p>
<p>The Kings are basically the “According to Jim” of the regular season.</p>
<p>But without sucking.</p>
<p>Let’s do it again, boys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GO KINGS GO!</p>
