				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s here! The NHL Playoffs!  Our lives are on hold until further notice.</p>
<p>Welcome to our annual playoff predictions, where Chuck selects teams based on actual hockey things and Pants make wishes on shiny pennies. (note from Pants: Amazingly, we have about the same track record. Maybe I learn things through texting with her.)</p>
<h4>Eastern Conference</h4>
<h5><strong>Canadiens vs. Senators</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Chuck:</strong> Senators. I know their late season surge is partially responsible for the Bruins not making the playoffs, but come on, people.  There is no way in seven hells that I&#8217;m rooting for the Canadiens to win.  Plus the Sens have momentum on their side &#8211; they won their last three games vs the Habs and they are riding the hot glove of the Hamburgler.</p>
<p><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://38.media.tumblr.com/92810532838ccbe240599461b5070b09/tumblr_n5b7oiZlGk1rfduvxo1_500.gif" alt="" width="500" height="275" /></p>
<p><strong>Pants:</strong> WHO CARES? No, really. I think the Habs will win because <a title="Foxy Friday: Carey Price" href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/2013/04/19/foxy-friday-carey-price/">Carey Price</a>. And I hope they will win because they are predictable when faced by a next-round opponent who could by one of my teams. The Sens have lived up to their &#8220;pesky&#8221; reputation time and again, and I don&#8217;t have the stomach for their upswings now.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-22205 size-full aligncenter" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/thats-all.gif" alt="thats all" width="500" height="200" /></p>
<p><strong>Lightning vs. Red Wings</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chuck:</strong> Lightning. A deep forward corps and young guns like Palat &amp; Kucherov give the Bolts eletricity in the scoring department.  Foxy Friday <a title="Foxy Friday: Brian Boyle" href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/2011/12/30/foxy-friday-brian-boyle/">Brian Boyle</a> is holding down the 4th line, scored 15 goals, and has even played shifts of defense. We love guys that can multitask. But the thought of losing the <a title="Foxy Friday: Henrik Zetterberg" href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/2013/04/26/foxy-friday-henrik-zetterberg/">Zetterbeard</a> so early in the playoffs&#8230;.</p>
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://38.media.tumblr.com/549be27f02ca77880f8b7e8e25764ac8/tumblr_nk4hknb6uw1unjwc8o1_500.gif" alt="" width="500" height="280" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Not okay.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pants:</strong> Uh, Lighting. Apologies to <a href="https://twitter.com/lm1485">@lm1485</a>&#8216;s grandmother and the stuffed duck on her porch who wears a Red Wings jersey, but the Wings are on the downward slope away from the top of the League.  We know what it&#8217;s like to look around and suddenly, everyone else is 25.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-22204 size-full aligncenter" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/magotes.gif" alt="magotes" width="500" height="278" /></p>
<p><strong>Rangers vs. Penguins</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chuck:</strong> Rangers.  NYR went b***s to the wall at the trade deadline and made some very strategic moves to complete their roster. <a title="It’s Good to be… Rick Nash" href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/2013/03/27/its-good-to-be-rick-nash/"> Rick Nash</a> has been his best against the Pens this season with 7 points over 4 games (3 of which the Rangers won).  Add in the the 1-2 goaltending punch of <a title="Foxy Friday: Henrik Lundqvist" href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/2012/02/10/foxy-friday-henrik-lundqvist/">Lundqvist</a> and Talbot, and the Rangers are a force that should put other East teams on notice.</p>
<p><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://33.media.tumblr.com/bf6aaa54abd4c1d45f8eee135c6f6b97/tumblr_ngvllqteKz1s9lptno1_500.gif" alt="" width="500" height="278" /></p>
<p><strong>Pants:</strong> PENGUINS. If I learned anything from <em>Grease</em>,<del> it was: what skipping a period meant</del> it was: if I can&#8217;t be an athlete, be an athletic supporter. Short of lacing up some skates and toe picking my way out there to hold a &amp;$%#ing lead myself (I considered this), the only solution is to focus my energy into a laser beam of love and intention &#8211; hopefully one that can move the puck away from the Pens&#8217; net. Maybe instead of watching <em>Grease</em>, I should have kept watching <em>Star Wars</em>. Also, if I haven&#8217;t mentioned it in five minutes, I hate the Rangers.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-22203 size-full aligncenter" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/leia-push.gif" alt="leia push" width="500" height="213" /></p>
<p><strong>Capitals vs. Islanders</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chuck:</strong>  Push.  These teams have not met in the playoffs since 1993 so you know that this is going to be some hype. Islanders are moving out of Nassau Coliseum at the end of this season so that might make give this series and playoffs some extra gravitas, but I think that these teams are pretty evenly matched. High-powered captains? Check. Goaltending? Check. Puck possession teams? Check.  This one is gonna be gooood. #BuckleUp</p>
<p><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://33.media.tumblr.com/4daac6aa85f4ae7668861f4bb47848af/tumblr_mkuypcgORG1s8v4e4o1_500.gif" alt="" width="500" height="265" /></p>
<p><strong>Pants:</strong> Capitals yaaaaaaaaas. But why does this have to be? Why can&#8217;t I just want John Tavares and his pleated khaki, double-strapped backpack, tucked-in shirt and first day of school haircut to win in the playoffs? Still, I don&#8217;t. As I wrote about in <a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/2015/02/25/two-of-hearts/">my guide to liking more than one team</a>, you need to prioritize and stick to your guns. Even when the other gun looks like this:</p>

And let me tell you, Derpy doesn&#8217;t get any Derpier. Derp.</p>

<p>And what a weekend for TBG. Saturday he gets his beautiful face shoved in the stations ala Max P. but thank god he was OK. Then he has a beauty of a goal against Dallas to help the Kings win a knuckle biter against their division rivals that went down to the wire too! Dallas ties it with less than 40 seconds to go and the Kings come back with a grinder that Handzus smacks in seconds later. Two points and that puts LA in fourth. Being the eternal optimist, I&#8217;m hoping they can stay in play-off contention.</p>

<p>Oh and Pittsburg played. They won. But what was really important, Letang played. <strong>Three games: Ovi, TBG and Letang; a trifecta of hockey gods.</strong> Sleep well my friends.
