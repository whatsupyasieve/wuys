<p>It turns out I really miss those.</p>
<p>The NHL handed out their awards over the weekend while I had no internet and no idea it was happening.  Oh well.  My campaign for a &#8220;make up for the lockout and no All-Star Game&#8221; program involving a swimsuit competition and push-up contest apparently fell on deaf ears.</p>

<p><strong>Hart Trophy/League MVP &#8211; Alex Ovechkin</strong></p>

	<em>Is that a tray of watches and potato pancakes?</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Mmmmmkay.  I would have gone with Crosby, but research indicates I may be biased.  Can you miss 1/4 of 1/2 of a season and still be MVP?  Fine, I guess not &#8211; but Sid only lost <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nhl/blog/eye-on-hockey/22432048/nhl-awards-alex-ovechkin-wins-third-hart-trophy-as-mvp">by 4 votes</a>.  I did admit this was the first year I have appreciated Ovi.  If this award inspires him to play like his three Hart-worthy seasons (instead of last season!) in the future, it&#8217;s cool by me.</p>
<p>John Tavares, what do you think?</p>

<p><strong>Selke/Best Defensive Forward &#8211; Jonathan Toews</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16843" alt="EA Sports NHL 11 Launch Event" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/toews.jpg" width="406" height="473" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/toews.jpg 451w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/toews-257x300.jpg 257w" sizes="(max-width: 406px) 100vw, 406px" /></p>
<p>Approved.  Chuck would say Bergy but with the season the Hawks had, seeing one of their lead offensive players (T-1st in team goals, 2nd in points) also be their best defensive forward is especially impressive.  Why work that hard when you&#8217;re winning all the time anyway?  Because it&#8217;s a huge part of how you win all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Lady Byng/Sportsmanship &#8211; Marty St. Louis</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16849" alt="squishy" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/squishy.png" width="466" height="263" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/squishy.png 1600w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/squishy-300x168.png 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/squishy-500x281.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px" /></p>
<p>HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SQUISHY!!  He&#8217;s 38 today.  It&#8217;s easy to assume Squishy wins this award (almost) every year because he&#8217;s small.  Not true.  Brad Marchand is small.  You with me?  St. Louis also lead the NHL in points &#8211; at 37, he was the oldest player to ever do this.  Score that much and be nice about it? Our moms are so proud.</p>
<p><strong>Vezina/Best Goaltender &#8211; Segei Bobrovsky</strong></p>

<p>In a world where Bobrovsky was traded and now the Flyers will buyout Bryzgalov&#8217;s monster contract, are you laughing a little?  I&#8217;m laughing.  I also applaud Bob&#8217;s gutsy choice of suit and tie.  Gotta be sauve when you&#8217;re up against King Henrik.</p>
<p><strong>Norris/Best Defenseman &#8211; PK Subban</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16845" alt="pk" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/pk.jpg" width="432" height="256" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/pk.jpg 675w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/pk-300x177.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/pk-500x296.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px" /></p>
<p>I know voting only takes regular season into account, but if this went to Kris Letang after the Pens&#8217; playoffs even I would have been ashamed.  Maybe next year, Tanger.  Maybe you need a ponytail holder.  I don&#8217;t like Subban but I&#8217;d like him if he were on my team.  <a href="http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/console?catid=53&amp;id=185521">All those chin-ups</a> with the 100 lb. of extra weight have paid off.</p>

<p>I saw maybe 3 Panthers games all year and Huberdeau scored in all of them so I&#8217;m on board with this.  Jon also has the appropriately wry jawline and poufy hair potential to replace Matt Smith as <em>Doctor Who</em>, if they could tape only in summer.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay/Most Outstanding Player (by NHLPA) &#8211; Sidney Crosby</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16848" alt="sid2" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sid2.jpg" width="480" height="412" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sid2.jpg 800w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sid2-300x257.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sid2-500x429.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></p>
<p>Being voted Most Outstanding by fellow players in pretty great.  Sid would rather have the Cup, the Richard, the Hart&#8230; but this award <em>is</em> this season for Sid, especially with his injury.  I&#8217;m not going to gush.  Just sum up my feelings with the time Sid went to a Justin Beiber concert in the same week I went to a Justin Beiber concert.  I love everything.  Hold it together, girls.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16847" alt="sid beiber" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sid-beiber.jpg" width="392" height="236" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sid-beiber.jpg 560w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sid-beiber-300x180.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sid-beiber-500x300.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px" /></p>
