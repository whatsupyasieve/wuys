<blockquote><p><em>Disclaimers:</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Chuck:</strong> I have watched some Western Conferences games this year, but those 10pm start times are killers. My predictions are based off:  the games I HAVE watch; NHL Network, what I&#8217;ve read about the teams, and Ms. Cleo.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Pants:</strong> I need to be honest here for a second. Can I vote for the Oilers? No? Then I don&#8217;t know anything about the West. I will predict &#8211; I may even have emotions &#8211; but everything I think about the Western Conf. is learned from reading other predictions or the final NHL standings. Basically, I am cheating off all your tests.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>western conference</h4>
<h5><strong>Blues vs. Wild</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Chuck:</strong> Blues. But maybe the Wild?  Wild have been the best team in the NHL since January and the exceptional play of Devan Dubnyk has carried them through, but the Blues have a sniper in Tarasenko and a deep corps of forwards and defenseman. This one is a conundrum, for sure.</p>
<p><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://38.media.tumblr.com/e3ef0fa32771ad732a76fec2507f3708/tumblr_ngx18xRKdC1sliirlo1_500.gif" alt="" width="500" height="291" /></p>
<p><strong>Pants:</strong> Blues. They always seem to be giving my teams a hard time, so this year will be not different. Also, <a title="Foxy Friday: Robert Bortuzzo" href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/2014/11/07/foxy-friday-robert-bortuzzo/">BORT&#8217;S BEARD! </a>I needs it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Predators vs. Blackhawks</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Chuck:</strong> Predators. I’m going out on a limb for this one but just hear me out. Preds’ defensemen make an in so many ways and Weber and<a title="Foxy Friday: Roman Josi" href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/2014/01/03/foxy-friday-roman-josi/"> Josi </a>are a stellar 1-2 punch. James Neal, when he is in the zone, can score goals that other guys just can’t. Hawks’ defense has been meh of late and Crawford can’t do it without good players in front of him.</p>
<p><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://33.media.tumblr.com/fe4b23604549680a575fb04967edf8bf/tumblr_inline_n8gy71X33I1rbumi6.gif" alt="" width="396" height="223" /></p>
<p><strong>Pants:</strong> Probably the Predators, because they&#8217;ve been rock solid all season. Also, I have <a title="BeardWatch 2013: The Ginger Beard Edition" href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/2013/05/23/beardwatch-2013-the-ginger-beard-edition/">Gingerbeard </a>withdrawal something fierce. The Hawks have had their ups-and-downs, though they are getting Patrick Kane back right on cue to make me eat these words.</p>
<p><img class="  wp-image-22215 aligncenter" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/neal2.jpg" alt="neal2" width="415" height="265" /></p>
<h5><strong>Ducks vs. Jets</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Chuck:</strong> Ducks.  Ducks has strength on pretty much all four lines and if their forechecking is on point, they are probably one of the best in the league. Paul Maurice has changed slowly changed the identity and culture of the Jets but they aren’t quite there&#8230;yet.  But I wouldn&#8217;t be mad at ALL if the Jets pulled this upset off.</p>
<p><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://38.media.tumblr.com/93a2de73e18b9ec59e617a70b538b0b1/tumblr_neirhoryxg1sxaki2o1_500.gif" alt="" width="500" height="206" /></p>
<p><strong>Pants:</strong> Ducks. If you&#8217;ve never watched Bruce Boudreau coach, please take this opportunity. If he was an iso-cam feed during games, I would never need to see the ice.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-22217 aligncenter" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/bruce.gif" alt="bruce" width="480" height="270" /></p>
<h5><strong>Canucks vs. Flames</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Chuck:</strong> Flames. I don’t have a dog in this fight since the Bruins are out so I am looking for a team to adopt.  Maybe the Flames are it. So what that they haven’t won a playoff round since 2004 (when the lost in the SCF)?  Great coach in Bob Hartley, a hugely successful powerplay and their ability to win without Giordano might make the Flames a dark horse.</p>
<p><strong>Pants: </strong>When I go to horse races, I bet on whichever horse has the best drag queen name. (So far, Surly Temple is the all-time favorite.) So when I say I can&#8217;t pick a team in this series, know how deeply and truly I do not care. I seem to have a lot of Canuck fan friends though, and I wish them well.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-22220 aligncenter" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/dont-care.gif" alt="dont care" width="500" height="237" /></p>
<h5>Comment below and let us know your predictions.  Who&#8217;s your dark horse team?</h5>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since <em>Psych</em> was not renewed for a 9th season, Chuck &amp; I are officially the best faux-psychic show in town.  No time is more ripe for our charlatan act than Day 1 of the 2014 NHL playoffs.  So sit back and allow us to disagree <em>slightly</em> on who will win in the first round.</p>

<p><strong>Bruins vs. Red Wings</strong></p>
<p>Pants: Bruins, because there is no way I get off this easily in life.  They&#8217;re packed and they&#8217;re stacked, especially in the back (<em>Shoop!</em>).  Tuukka Rask, brick wall with a 2.04 GAA.</p>
<p>Chuck:  Bruins, duh. I mean, I love me some Zetterbeard and the Red Wings did take 3 of 4 from the Black and Gold in the regular season.  But this is the playoffs.  And the Bruins always crank it up to 11 in the playoffs. (<em>Can I get some fries with that shake shake booty?</em>)</p>

<p><strong>Penguins vs. Blue Jackets</strong></p>
<p>Pants: Penguins, because I NEED THIS, OKAY?  Also they&#8217;ve beaten Columbus five times this season, Letang is getting up to form and Malkin could be back in the lineup tonight.  Fleury is near the top in every category and I&#8217;m banking on confidence.</p>
<p>Chuck: I love a good underdog story, and this series could be it.  I know this is FAAAAR from popular option with our readership but just lemme finish. The Blue Jackets are a difficult team to play against.  One coach told Kevin Weekes who told me that Columbus was a &#8220;nightmare every time you play them.&#8221;  They have some underrated guys and they&#8217;re physical.  Last year, Pens went up against the Bruins, arguable one of the most physical NHL teams, and they got swept.  But it is Pittsburgh, so I could be wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Lightning vs. Canadiens</strong></p>
<p>Pants: Canadiens, because the Bolts lost the one-two punch they needed to win this series when St. Louis bailed.  A shame, since Alexis says Tampa&#8217;s beard potential is astronomical.</p>
<p>Chuck: Lightning. Because I cannot. I will not.  It will be a cold day in hell before I cheer for the Canadiens.</p>

<p><strong>Flyers vs. Rangers</strong></p>
<p>Pants: Evil, because that is the only choice.  I&#8217;ll say Rangers here but it won&#8217;t be easy. The Flyers score slightly fewer G/G (by .22) but Lundqvist&#8217;s GAA is marginally better (by 0.14) than Mason&#8217;s &#8211; who is <a href="http://www.csnphilly.com/hockey-philadelphia-flyers/steve-mason-out-game-1-vs-rangers">hurt, thanks Kaitlin</a>, and out for at least Game 1.  That doesn&#8217;t help Philly.  Whoever wins plays the winner of PIT/CBJ and I don&#8217;t see the Flyers leaving anything but a streak of blood to get there.  Rangers in a long, brutal series.</p>
<p>Chuck: Rangers&#8230;I guess.  Both teams have fought and scrapped to make the playoffs, especially the Flyers, who have seemed to recover from their disatrous start.  Rangers&#8217; goaltending and defense are better but this match-up has some serious Hunger Games potential.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WEST</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Avalanche vs. Wild</strong></p>
<p>Pants: Avs, because Patrick Roy says so.  He&#8217;s turned the worst team in last year&#8217;s West into the 2nd best team in this year&#8217;s West.  Varlamov has seen more shots than any goalie and won more games.  By comparison, the Avs&#8217; offense ranks 20th in shots per game &#8211; but they are accurate, with 2.99 G/G (5th overall).  High-quality offense, high-quality goaltender.</p>
<p>Chuck: Avalanche, because why not them?  They are young, exceptionally talented, and have a top notch goalie in Varlamov. Nathan McKinnon is a shoe-in for the Calder and the rest of the forward crew ain&#8217;t to shabby.  While the wheels were coming off the Blues&#8217; bus, the Avs leapfrogged over them to take the Central. Remember last year&#8217;s Red Sox team?  They went from worst to first and won the World Series.  Just saying&#8230;.</p>

<p><strong>Ducks vs. Stars</strong></p>
<p>Pants: Ducks, because they score more than any other team.  They&#8217;re #1 at 3.21/game.  The dark horse is that Dallas draws a lot of penalties (3rd overall), and Anaheim&#8217;s penalty kill ranks 13th 82.2%.  So there are freebies to be had, Stars.  I still think the Ducks overpower them.</p>
<p>Chuck: My heart says Stars, but my head says Ducks. For reasons.  Namely, Perry, Getzlaf, Bonino, Selanne. Seguin and Benn have one of the best bromance/chemistry in the NHL right now, but it won&#8217;t be enough to overpower the Ducks.</p>

<p><strong>Blues vs. Blackhawks</strong></p>
<p>Pants: Blackhawks.  Only 4 points separate them.  The Blues are slumping hard &#8211; they lost 6 of 8 in April.  I would not want to ride that streak into the post-season against the defending Champs.  If Toews &amp; Kane are really ready, like ready-ready, they can tip that balance.</p>
<p>Chuck: Blackhawks. Toews and Kane are back. Even at 75%, they are still pretty awesome.  Blues spent the month of April on a cross-country trip on the struggle bus, which not the way you want to go into the playoffs.  If Blues can return to their regular season form and get some guys back, they could have a shot.  But the WUYS Magic 8 Ball is saying &#8220;Outlook look not so good.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Sharks vs. Kings</strong></p>
<p>Pants: Snore.  Don&#8217;t these teams play every year?  Just two of the last four.  I&#8217;ll pick the Sharks for the same reason I always do: aren&#8217;t they tired of eventually losing in the Playoffs?  The Sharks are always a fire drill, never a fire.</p>
<p>Chuck: Sharks. Please dear Lord, the Sharks. I need Joe Thornton&#8217;s playoff beard to make me whole and happy.</p>

<p>Hurrah for <a title="Foxy Friday: Gabriel Landeskog" href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2011/10/28/foxy-friday-gabriel-landeskog/">Gabe Landeskog</a> on one hell of a game.</p>
<p>After missing the pre-game skate with flu-like symptoms, he somehow managed to tough it out and <strong>score the game-winning goal (his 4th GWG of the season)</strong> versus the Kings in OT last night.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/ugbTfzC9bu4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>When I have the flu, all I want to do is eat saltines, drink ginger ale, and watch bad movies like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIclPmde1hM&amp;feature=fvst">&#8220;Teen Witch&#8221;</a>.  The thought of having to play 60 minutes of hockey when all you want to do is hurl makes me want to hurl.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how you did it, kid.</p>
<p>Landeskog also had three shots in the game bringing his season tally to 235 for the year, <strong>breaking Peter Stasny&#8217;s franchise rookie record</strong> for shots set waaaaay back in 1980-81 (12 years before GL92 was even a fetus.)</p>
<p>The Avalanche are in a desperate fight for a playoff spot so they are gonna need every point they can get.  Last night&#8217;s win moved them into 8th in the Western Conference.</p>

<p>With Matt Duchene out with a ankle injury, the Avs are going to have to depend guys like Landeskog, O&#8217;Reilly, and Stasny to keep them in the hunt.  Also critical to their playoffs hopes is the goaltending of Varlamov.  He&#8217;s been playing really well as of late and last night, he looked pretty tioght.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s hope that the Avs&#8217; young talent can sustain them and keep them in the race.</p>
<p>Because frankly, we&#8217;d love to see more of this.</p>

<p><em>P.S.  Kudos to Landeskog for giving a very nice, poised, coherent post-game interview.  So often, I cringe every time players do post-games because 99% of them are in desperate need of media training.  <strong>But Gabe was perfect</strong>.  Kid is gonna be a superstar.</em></p>
