				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Get it? &#8220;If you&#8217;re gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band&#8221;? No? Oh well. Country music problems. Today we have another guest training camp report, this time from Texas and courtesy of <strong>Brenda (<a href="http://twitter.com/wishinonehand">@wishinonehand</a>)</strong>!</p>
<p>The day before Brenda was heading to Texas on vacation, she got a Facebook message from a friend: Henrik Lundqvist was doing a signing at Birchbox in SoHo for the first 150 people who bought either a t-shirt or a pair of boxer briefs from <a href="http://breadandboxers.com/int/"><strong>Bread &amp; Boxers</strong></a> (for whom he&#8217;s a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">spokesmodel</span> spokesman). So of course she ran for the door, down the street and got there 2.5 hours early. To be 6th in line.  She managed some coherent speech and minimal swooning while posing for this:</p>
<div id="attachment_22330" style="width: 418px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-22330 " src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/hank-brenda.jpg" alt="hank brenda" width="408" height="397" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/hank-brenda.jpg 487w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/hank-brenda-300x291.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mr. June, obviously.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Brenda, “His shirt was SO SOFT” and she strongly resisted the urge to pet his hair. Because you can’t be in jail <em>and</em> go to Austin for a week of Stars practice! On to Texas, where Brenda stayed with <a href="https://twitter.com/vickyandnikki/"><strong>Vicky</strong></a> (of <a href="https://vickyandnikkis5hole.wordpress.com/"><strong>VickyAndNikkisFiveHole</strong></a>). She reports:</p>
<p>Day 1: Jamie Benn seems to be pretty well recovered from his surgery. Must be that new <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">strength and conditioning coach</span> fitness model he&#8217;s been dating. He was skating quite a bit on a line with Eaves, which is WAY too much hotness for one line.</p>
<div id="attachment_22320" style="width: 357px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-22320" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/day-1-domain-party-jamie-500x721.jpg" alt="Parts his hair with a protractor." width="347" height="497" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Parts his hair with a protractor.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Between practices they brought in a huge group of little kids on a school field trip, who all got Seguin jerseys and were quizzed them about hockey and the Stars. Seggy took a selfie with them [<a href="https://twitter.com/tseguinofficial/status/644940507685126144">Twitter</a>]. Seguin &amp; Sharp also spent a bunch of time on a line together. If we thought that the combo of Benn &amp; Eaves was as good as it could get, Sharpie &amp; Seggy certainly gave them a run for their money.</p>
<div id="attachment_22328" style="width: 461px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-22328" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/day-4-scrimmage-BC-sharp-500x428.jpg" alt="Pants: I forgot he was a Star." width="451" height="388" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Pants: Completely forgot he was a Star.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later in the day, Jordie Benn’s beard showed off its post-season form. And I&#8217;m just going to say right now that the moment that <strong><a href="https://instagram.com/s_johns28/">Stephen</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/stjohns28">Johns</a></strong> makes it to the NHL, he&#8217;ll need a Foxy Friday IMMEDIATELY. (Pants, he has a ginger beard!).</p>
<div id="attachment_22322" style="width: 426px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-22322" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/day-1-practice-C-johns-500x427.jpg" alt="Okay, we believe you." width="416" height="357" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Okay, we believe you.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later that night the Stars had an outdoor fan fest, which included a bouncy house (for kids only – <em>boo</em>) and a TERRIBLE cover band who wore different colored Adidas track. [Pants note: That sounds kind of awesome.] There were Q&amp;A sessions and I was able to get autographs from all of the players who were there. I also got to meet the lovely <a href="https://twitter.com/Classlicity"><strong>Carolyn</strong></a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/merrinish"><strong>Merrin</strong></a> from <a href="https://twobeardedladies.wordpress.com/"><strong>Two Bearded Ladies</strong></a>. I felt an immediate bond with Carolyn upon learning of our shared deep and abiding love of Brandon Bollig. Of course I also managed to find a fellow NY Ranger fan and had to introduce myself to him. #BlueshirtsUnited [Pants note: Hashtags you’ll never again see on this blog.]</p>
<p>Day 2: <a href="https://twitter.com/vickydombroski"><strong>Vicky</strong></a> &amp; I were running late, and spied Jordie Benn, Jason Demers, Kari Lehtonen &amp; 2 other players trying to get back into the arena after apparently running to the nearby gas station for snacks. [Pants note: They need an Intern Jeff Skinner!] Eventually someone did let them in. Incredibly, not even three minutes later, Demers was already on the ice. How did he get dressed so quickly???</p>
<p>On Day 2, the Stars decided to unveil their strategy for the upcoming season: blind the rest of the league with their beauty. For a large portion of the practice, Benn, Seguin, Sharp, Demers &amp; Oduya skated together as a 5-man unit. Jesus, Dallas, are you trying to KILL us??? I&#8217;m shocked that the ice did not melt (full disclosure: we melted – A LOT). A bunch of other stuff happened at practice, too, but honestly, who cares?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Day 3: Today was the &#8220;official&#8221; scrimmage that you had to pay to attend, as well as the only day concession stands were open, so of course I took advantage and had a frozen strawberry margarita. We were excited that they were handing out rally towels to fans, until we discovered that they were left over from Mike Modano&#8217;s retirement night from 2014. Very lame, Stars! Vicky &amp; I were joined by Le&#8217;Loni, Micah &amp; Laura, her fellow Texas Stars Ice Patrol friends, and Nikki, the other half of <a href="https://vickyandnikkis5hole.wordpress.com/"><strong>VickyAndNikkisFiveHole</strong></a>. We were NOTHING but trouble. A lot of people were SUPER PISSED that Jamie Benn &amp; Ales Hemsky didn&#8217;t skate in the scrimmage. Still, it was really fun. Seggy looked great, scoring 2 goals but missing on a penalty shot.</p>
<div id="attachment_22321" style="width: 394px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-22321" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/day-1-practice-B-seggy-abs-500x511.jpg" alt="You miss 100% of the abs you never show." width="384" height="392" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/day-1-practice-B-seggy-abs-500x511.jpg 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/day-1-practice-B-seggy-abs-294x300.jpg 294w" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">You miss 100% of the abs you never show.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The funniest part of the day was that <a href="https://twitter.com/merrinish"><strong>Merrin</strong></a> was able to get Jamie to sign the notebook (available at the <a href="https://twobeardedladies.wordpress.com/"><strong>Two Bearded Ladies</strong></a> online <a href="http://www.redbubble.com/people/twobl?SSAID=314743&amp;utm_source=shareasale&amp;utm_medium=affiliates&amp;utm_campaign=banner"><strong>shop</strong></a>) that has a picture of a sloth in a hockey helmet hanging from a hockey stick along with a quote from Jamie&#8217;s scouting report: &#8220;We&#8217;re not sure if he&#8217;s really that slow, or if he just refuses to move.&#8221; Well done, ma&#8217;am.</p>

<p>Day 4: The best part of the ENTIRE camp was that after the scrimmage (and after the laps that both squads had to skate), Sharp and Oduya were out on the ice. We thought maybe they were going to do some drills with the coaches, but then Oduya skated off. Sharp skated a bit with the puck and then shot it right at the boards below us (we were sitting right on the glass). We laughed and waved at him. He skated by and then turned around and smiled at us and flipped the puck over the glass to me. Another woman who was sitting at the other end of the row went to get it (it had gone behind me), but there was ZERO CHANCE I was letting anyone get the puck that Sharpie had clearly wanted ME to have. Shockingly, in my entire life (we don&#8217;t need to talk about exactly how many years that is), this is the first time I&#8217;ve ever had a player give me a puck. A 3-time Stanley Cup champion is a pretty outstanding place to start, don&#8217;t you think?</p>
<div id="attachment_22329" style="width: 382px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-22329" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/day-5-morning-skate-puck-500x486.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="372" height="362" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/day-5-morning-skate-puck-500x486.jpg 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/day-5-morning-skate-puck-300x291.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 372px) 100vw, 372px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Signed: The World&#8217;s Most Handsome Man</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Day 5: After the last practice, Sharpie was talking to some of the fans on his way off the ice and I was able to get him to sign the puck he&#8217;d given me the day before (side bar: his hands are <em>very soft</em>). YESSSS!!! So in the space of 8 days, I met 2 of the 3 best looking men in the NHL (Patrice Bergeron being the third – although I met him at the NHL store this past season), which is pretty ridiculous. I am feeling very blessed. Thank you, hockey gods!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankfully pre-season hockey is here and regular season hockey is right around the corner. <strong>Let&#8217;s go Rangers!</strong></p>
<p>[Pants note: I’ll let her have that one. Thank you, Brenda! And be sure to check out the other female-written hockey blogs in this post: <a href="https://twitter.com/vickyandnikki">@vickyandnikki</a>  and <a href="https://twitter.com/beardiestladies">@beardiestladies</a>!]</p>

<p>Aside from the hair, we know almost nothing about Jamie.  He&#8217;s never been (I honestly just typed &#8220;benn&#8221;) tagged in a single post.  We know he stands next to Tyler Seguin sometimes.  We know Jamie resembles our friend Matty D, who also lives in Texas, and that Texas is in a different time zone.  But we can never remember which one.</p>
<p><del>At least we know his team&#8217;s not called the Texas Stars.</del> (Rats my joke is ruined by this being correct! Merrin points out this is AHL.  See, how much we&#8217;re learning?  Our fault for doubting <em>The Hockey News&#8217;</em> typesetters.)</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">So we looked him up.  Based on his star turn at the Olympics and the many hockey-related accolades Jamie receives from gushing commentators, it seemed obvious that his on-ice play is something special.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="font-size: 14.44444465637207px; font-style: normal;" alt="benn" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/benn.png" width="523" height="145" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Credited as someone with &#8220;tremendous versatility&#8221; who &#8220;never quits on a play&#8221; [<a href="http://www.defendingbigd.com/2013/8/23/4648974/the-case-for-jamie-benn-as-stars-captain">DefendingBigD.com</a>], Benn is a consistent 20+ goal guy.  If he keeps pace, he&#8217;ll break the 30 goal mark this season for the first time in his career.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Jamie lead the Stars in scoring last year.  This season he&#8217;s got some flashy help in the form of Tyler Seguin, with whom he shares the top of the stats chart.  Look how far ahead they are of everyone else:</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Benn has become the &#8220;face of a franchise&#8221; in Dallas &#8211; an odd title, not undeserved but seemingly dropped on him by a team that has let all their other faces go: Brad Richards went UFA, Loui Eriksson, Mike Ribero, James Neal and Brendan Morrow were all traded.  The only other Star to ever outscore Benn was defenseman Stephane Robidas in JB&#8217;s rookie year.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The Stars move to acquire Seguin was a big one, and it&#8217;s paying off.  Jamie and his brother Jordie have gotten some credit for helping Chuck&#8217;s favorite bad boy settle down in Dallas [<a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1893302-inside-tyler-seguins-image-makeover-with-the-dallas-stars">link</a>].  Tyler lives in the same building, spends time with them and, based on this video, has encouraged Jamie to be drunk at work.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Seguin could be the perfect compliment to Jamie Benn&#8217;s personality.  Jamie is notoriously media-shy and awkward (two of our favorite things), and has even been called &#8220;robotic&#8221; [<a href="http://www.defendingbigd.com/2014/2/25/5444824/nhl-playoffs-jamie-benn-dallas-stars-team-canada">link</a>].  Yet his on-ice work got him appointed team captain back in September.  Not bad for a guy passed up until the fifth round of the &#8217;07 draft &#8211; who just might be coming out of his shell.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">We are not the only ones to overlook Jamie Benn.  He was left off the Team Canada Olympic orientation camp roster last summer.  No ball hockey, no Bachelorette nickname, nothing.  He sure showed us.  With a point-per-game through Oct/Nov., Benn clawed his way into the ranks and was given a bunk in Russia.  He scored the game winner in prelim play vs. Norway and then, with everything on the line:</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Jamie Benn scored the only goal of the Canada vs. USA matchup.  Team Canada advanced to the Gold Medal game.  A hero was born and,well, you know the rest.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Let&#8217;s review.  Tops in team scoring. Captain. Olympic gold medalist.  And now finally Foxy Friday.  Did we mention Benn&#8217;s goal and two assists last night in the victory over Carolina?  Currently 8th in a very tight mid-pack Western Conference, the Stars need every win if they&#8217;re going to make the playoffs for the first time in six years.</p>
