				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mr. Cherrie and I had the honor of attending the 2010 Olympics when they were a hop, skip and short drive from us. We didn&#8217;t have tickets to any of the men&#8217;s Ice Hockey games but the hockey gods smiled on us and dropped two front row seats to the Russia VS Slovakia game. And yes, we bought them at the box office.</p>

<p>We got a warm up puck and I banged on the glass at Pavol during the warm-ups because even though he played for Slovakia, I though he was hot. They won that night. A hard-fought game. They ended up coming in fourth in the Olympics. Quite a feat for a team that no one expected much from. A life and talent gone much too soon. You will all be missed.</p>
