<p>He took an extended leave of absence from the NHL for personal reasons and had just signed on with the Winnipeg Jets on what some say was a career comeback.</p>
<p>Derek Boogaard died a few months back; a mixture of alcohol and prescription drugs found in his system.</p>
<p>While we all joke about fighters and fights &#8211; I&#8217;m just as guilty &#8211; I love a good fight(s), and the NY Islanders having a viewing party of their game against the Penguins, some players have a hard time leaving it on the ice when they leave the ice.</p>
<p>My heart and prayers go out to the Rypien family and to any hockey player out there having personal issues. Please go get help &#8211; talk to some one, any one. You are more important than the game. You matter to someone. You make a difference. There is a sparkly rainbow on the other side &#8211; trust me.</p>

Yes, the fan was yelling something at him but so were many others. Yes, Tampa was dumb to give out noise clackers that were heavy enough that fans could throw far enough to make it onto the ice but again, this particular fan did not do anything <em>TO</em>Horton to deserve what he got. And yes, it&#8217;s water.</p>
<p>The incident happens at the 1:20 mark. The only film available is on Youtube: <em>(I got it to embed for you &#8211; Pants)</em></p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/TE_qdI4NKj0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>Puck Daddy mentions this YESTERDAY before Game 7 :</p>
<p>&#8220;Before the 2010-11 season, the NHL made it clear that players spraying fans with water bottles, even when there&#8217;s penalty box glass in between them, was outlawed. &#8221;</p>
<p>You may remember, John Tortorella, the coach of the NY Rangers, was suspended for a game for spraying a fan with a water bottle and NOT throwing anything. This was during the 2009 playoffs. But there was a big who-ha about this when it happened. And I am not going to compare this to Rick Rypien of the Canucks because that is silly.</p>
<p>But the NHL did NOT suspend Horton nor provide any disciplinary action for the incident. However, there was a precedent and where is the disciplinary consistency? But if they HAD, would Boston have won game 7 against Tampa Bay since Nathan Horton snagged his second game winning goal? He now has a NHL record of scoring two game winning, game 7 goals in the same playoff year.</p>
<p>I was a little shocked that no media asked either coaches about this nor Versus or the CBC brought this up during the post-game analysis. It seems like everyone wanted to just sweep it under the rug.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not trying to take anything away from Boston or their win tonight, nor Nathan Horton but I certainly hope perhaps the classy Tim Thomas takes him aside, sits him down and has a long talk with him about sportsmanship, being a professional and keeping his emotions in check. Because watching game 7 and then seeing all the interviews with this young man afterward, knowing about his shameful behaviour towards the Tampa Bay fans, made it a little hard to feel good about his achievements. I hope he realized he dodged a huge bullet.</p>

<p><strong>On a lighter note, Tim Thomas gave the BEST QUOTE ever, post-game when Scott Oakes asked him how he planned on handling Vancouver, &#8220;Well .. obviously, ah, I just plan on stopping as many pucks as possible!&#8221;</strong>  Good plan Tim. How can you not love this guy?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night against the Wild, Canuck Rick Rypien attacked a fan on his way to the locker room after getting a 10 minute major for his second fight. Personally, I think if you taunt a NHL player who has exhibited this kind of behavior, it&#8217;s like stabbing an angry tiger that&#8217;s just been stung by a thousand wasps &#8211; and you get what you pay for. If you have to pay with your body, then cash it in baby. Stupid is and stupid does. But I like hockey fights and it&#8217;s even better when it&#8217;s a stupid fan.</p>

<p>Then I have to add this classic clip of Ti Domi when a drunk Philly fan fell into the penalty box for your entertainment.</p>
