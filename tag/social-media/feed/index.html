				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh snap.  We are so ahead of the game!  Monday has come and gone, and today <strong>guess who&#8217;s featured on the NHL.com homepage with a video highlight and a <a href="http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=542961">story</a>?  WUYS poster boy Mike Green</strong>.  I&#8217;ll keep this short, since Dawn has to listen to me all day long.</p>
<p>Mike launched a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/pages/Mike-Green-Fan-Site/167477083281796">Facebook fan site</a>.  I squeed.  This is the one and only time I will ever find sloppy grammar adorable!  He posted this video in which he&#8217;s half-asleep.  At any moment, Bettman is going to appear behind him in a ski mask and make him read a manifesto condemning hits to the head and the sale of the Coyotes.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m kidding!  I think this is great.  The NHL GMs meet today to discuss lots of things, including a social media policy (or lack thereof) for players on Twitter and Facebook.  <strong>I really hope they don&#8217;t decide to start policing this stuff </strong>&#8211; it&#8217;s absolutely fantastic for the fans.  Some of the content is off-color, but we let other celebrities talk, get political, all that.  If BizNasty wants to post a picture of himself giving a homeless guy a fiver, then rock on!  And (grimace) the Capitals have the best social media presence of any team in the League.</p>
<p>So Mike.  Sure we could get him to look at the camera and and take the &#8216; out of fan&#8217;s, but who cares?  Some people think Mike is dumb &#8211; I disagree.  <strong>He&#8217;s smart enough to be marketing himself instead of letting (hoping/waiting for?) the League to do it for him.</strong> They only see Crosby and Ovechkin.  Mike&#8217;s doing a national (American!!) ad campaign for GEICO while other guys are hawking pool supplies and local auto dealerships (nothing wrong with it, Talbot, just making a point).  Green is doing something right and I&#8217;m pretty sure he&#8217;s doing with a lot less help.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/fRHDYPenog4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>My inner publicist loves this.  I wish more of the players (or their media departments) would make a go of something similar.  <strong>How much fun would it be for the fans to see more personal interaction with the players?</strong> The NHL ranks 7th in American sports attendance numbers (as of 1/10) but is actually 5th according to a recent Harris Poll.  That&#8217;s just above the NBA and far higher than golf or tennis (<a href="http://gameofinches.blogspot.com/2010/01/most-popular-sports-in-america.html">source</a>).  We are getting there!  Now get out there and work it.  (Or <strong>hire me and Dawn to work it for you</strong>.)</p>
