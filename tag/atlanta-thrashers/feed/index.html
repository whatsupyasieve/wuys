<p>The only way this really affects us is that <strong>Chuck and I don&#8217;t know anyone in Winnipeg</strong>.  Well, except Jonathan Toews&#8217; mom and after we stay there all summer, boating on the lake and having derp face contests, we feel a little needy asking to come back in the winter.  But we will.</p>

	</a>Now, <strong>what do you call the Winnipeg team?</strong>  Dust off the Jets?  I can&#8217;t think of another instance where that&#8217;s happened, as usually relocated teams take their names with or start fresh in their new digs.  If they&#8217;re getting a new name,<strong> what would you call them?</strong></p>

	</a>What do you think?  Atlanta of all teams?  I guess it makes sense, if you read <strong><a href="http://www.forbes.com/2010/11/30/leafs-rangers-canadiens-business-sports-hockey-valuations-10-most-valuable-teams.html">this fascinating Forbes article</a></strong> about NHL revenue by team as of 12/10.</p>
<p><em>Forbes values six teams (Maple Leafs, Rangers, Canadiens, Red Wings, Philadelphia Flyers and Boston Bruins) in excess of $300 million and four teams (Nashville Predators, Lightning, Thrashers and Coyotes) at less than $150 million.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peter Chiarelli, Cam Neely, and the Bruins made some <strong>big moves</strong> today, ahead of the February 28th deadline.</p>
<p>They <em>FINALLY</em> did the deal to bring puck-moving Maple Leafs defenseman <strong>Tomas Kaberle</strong> to Boston in exchange for Bruins prospect forward <strong>Joe Colborne</strong> and a 1st round draft pick in 2011.  The deal also stipulates that should the Bs make it to the Stanley Cup Finals this year or re-sign Kaberle at the end of this season, they must also hand over a 2nd round draft pick in 2012.</p>
<div style="width: 522px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://theleafsnation.com/uploads/Image/tln%20tomas%20kaberle,%2015%20february%202011.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="363" /><p class="wp-caption-text">He&#039;s so excited!</p></div>
<p>Kaberle is in his 12th NHL season and has 3 goals, 35 assists, and 16 penalty minutes.  He&#8217;s decently sized (6&#8217;1&#8243;, 214lbs) but he is <strong>exactly </strong>what the Bruins have been lacking on their power play since Dennis Wideman left.  Kaberle can move the puck and work the point.  Since the trade rumors started maybe a a week or couple of weeks ago, I&#8217;m been praying to sweet little baby Jesus in his tuxedo t-shirt that the Bs would make this move.  Kaberle will be with the team tonight (Friday) in Ottawa and will wear #12.  (His #15 was not available as it was Milt Schmidt&#8217;s number which is retired and hanging in the Garden rafters.)</p>

<p>In his presser this afternoon, Chiarelli did mention that it was very hard for them to let go of top prospect Colborne.  Although he has yet to make his NHL debut, Colborne was a player that the team was very high on.  He&#8217;s a <strong>beast</strong> &#8211; 6&#8217;5&#8243;, 213 lbs &#8211; and was their first round pick in 2008.  Chiarelli mentioned that he and other front office personnel called Colborne personally to tell him.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/300h.jpg?w=235" alt="" width="235" height="300" /></p>
<p>Bruins also picked speedy centerman <strong>Rich Peverley</strong> and defenseman <strong>Boris Valabik</strong> from the <strong>Atlanta Thrashers</strong> in exchange for defenseman <strong>Mark Stuart </strong>and forward <strong>Blake &#8220;Wheels&#8221; Wheeler</strong>.  Peverley gives the Bs added speed and crazy faceoff winning skills (55.5% of faceoffs won).  He has 14 goals and 20 assists this season and will join the team on the 20th.  Valabik will go down to Providence to join the Bruins&#8217; minor league affiliate.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.hockeybarn.com/images_content/lib/200911/W1AQZs" alt="" width="306" height="172" /></p>
<p>While I am a little bummed that &#8220;Wheels&#8221; is gone (because I liked him as a player), I&#8217;m very happy and optimistic that the Bruins have made some positive changes to their line up.  With the addition of <strong>Chris Kelly</strong> from Ottawa earlier this week, the Bs look to have put together a strong team with which to make their playoff run.  Add into the mix 4 solid lines that can score and the best goaltending duo in the league and this girl is one happy bear!</p>
