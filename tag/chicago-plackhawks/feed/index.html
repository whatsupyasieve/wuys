<p>First, he and his wife Abby welcomed a baby girl, Madelyn Grace, on Friday.</p>

<p>Early Sunday, the proud papa brought her daughter and wife home.</p>
<p>Sunday night, he scored his 2nd straight overtime game winner in a row to beat the Sharks 3-2. [<a href="http://video.blackhawks.nhl.com/videocenter/console?hlg=20112012,2,434&amp;event=CHI649">Watch it here.</a>]</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It was a pretty emotional goal,&#8221; Sharp said. &#8220;It was tough to focus on hockey with so much going on back home. We have a great locker room. It&#8217;s pretty easy to turn things off when you come to the rink, but I was space cadet the whole game.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Now that Sharpie is a dad, he&#8217;s going to need babysitters, right?</p>
<p>Personally, we think that Toews would be an <em>excellent</em> babysitter<strong>.</strong>  There would be lots of story time and coloring, games of hokey pokey and tea time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kane, on the other hand&#8230;not so much.   It would probably include running around and  jumping off of furniture.  Although, we&#8217;re pretty positive that if Madelyn wanted to dress Kane up and make his hair all pretty with bows and clips, he wouldn&#8217;t object.</p>
