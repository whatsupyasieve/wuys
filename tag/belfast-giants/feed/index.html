				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>WUYS BFF Cassy</strong> spent all day yesterday making sure good little boys and girls were treated to this Christmas delight.  I used to think the Blackhawks had the most fun, with their popsicle eating contests and fake beards, but I was wrong.  The <strong>Belfast Giants are the most fun hockey team on Earth</strong>.  Super-mega-ultra bonus points for also being Irish.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/Jl?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>I can&#8217;t even tell you what I would do for a Penguins version of this.  I want to see <strong>Malkin as the World&#8217;s Largest Elf</strong> running behind a kick-line clapping his hands like King Kong.  It&#8217;s like <strong>outtakes from <a href="http://whatsupyasieve.wordpress.com/2010/10/17/score-a-hockey-musical/">Score! The Hockey Musical</a></strong>.  And because, face it, you know Crosby can&#8217;t dance.  But you really want to see him try.</p>
<p><em>Thanks Cassy!</em></p>
