				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok, was anyone watching the Chicago Blackhawks and the Philadelphia Fliers last Sunday? <strong>Because this is a priceless little nugget of gold.</strong> Not because it was a rematch between the Stanley Cup teams of last year but because Marty Turco mocked Pierre Mcguire on national TV &#8211; NBC to be exact. Mike Milbury plows over him between periods when NBC has hockey games and everyone else talks over him. He&#8217;s the kid no one liked but kept showing up to play and always thought he should be captain. <strong>Someone even refered to his Stanley Cup Ring as his &#8216;decoder ring&#8217; </strong>which prompted me to ask Mr. Cherrie &#8220;He played hockey? He has a ring?&#8221; Mr. Cherrie shrugged and pulled up the internet and did some research. He won them as a &#8216;scout&#8217; and assistant coach with the Pittsburgh Penguins. <strong>That&#8217;s like getting &#8216;most improved&#8217; by proxy which explains why he wears them all the time.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Watching the AWESOME Winter Classic and Fabulous Washington Capital&#8217;s 3-1 Win over the Pens holding whining Slew-Foot Sid pointless <strong>MADE MY NEW YEAR! Welcome 2011!</strong> But the bizarre camera angles and annoying comentary from NBC made me wish my fellow WUYS tweeters had access to the CBC feed. Because Mr. Cherrie and I would have rather watched our lovely Canadian&#8217;s coverage who grudgingly moved around their beloved HNIC schedule to accommodate the time change of the WC game. Only Toronto and Ontario got their game feed uninterrupted because it was &#8220;The Battle of Ontario.&#8221; Everyone else in Canada got to watch the WC.</p>
<p>But this is NOT about the Winter Classic. This is about a <em><strong>SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT </strong></em>made during the Winter Classic. NBC announced HOCKEY DAY IN AMERICA. Now, I don&#8217;t want to split hairs here or get all semantic in your jockstrap BUT there are several things wrong with this announcement.</p>

	</a><p class="wp-caption-text">NBC programming executive for HOCKEY DAY IN AMERICA</p></div>First off, they stole this whole program from CANADA. I&#8217;d be the first person to congratulate them on creating such a thing but they didn&#8217;t. CANADA DID. It&#8217;s originally called HOCKEY DAY IN CANADA where <strong>ALL THE CANADIAN TEAMS IN CANADA PLAY EACH OTHER</strong>. It&#8217;s truly awesome and it&#8217;s HOCKEY ALL DAY! And you <em><strong>WATCH EACH GAME </strong></em>and it starts at the ass crack of dawn and goes to like midnight. <em>Remember this point</em>.</p>
<p>Secondly, HOCKEY DAY IN AMERICA would technically include Canada and Mexico (South America if I REALLY want to go there). Last time I checked Mexico didn&#8217;t have  hockey teams nor do they play hockey on a regular basis. I am not trying to be all PC but if you are stealing something, at least let&#8217;s not encompass EVERYTHING! It should be called HOCKEY DAY IN THE U.S.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1978" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/mapnorthamerica1.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-1978 " title="mapnorthamerica[1]" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/mapnorthamerica1.gif" alt="" width="490" height="367" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/mapnorthamerica1.gif 510w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/mapnorthamerica1-300x225.gif 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">NBC executives might want to reference this</p></div>Next up &#8211; NBC will have four games that day with TWO starting at 3PM Eastern: Washington VS. Buffalo and Philadelphia VS. NY Rangers. Riddle me this Batman &#8230; How is this helpful to Hockey fans?  Who programmed this? How is this HOCKEY <em><strong>DAY</strong></em> &#8230;? Did NBC figure out how to split the space-time continuum? Are they <em><strong>THAT AWESOME</strong></em>? Oh but it gets better or more, OK, I&#8217;m going totally un-PC  &#8211; full on retarded &#8211; Pittsburgh VS. Chicago starts at 4 PM Eastern and <em><strong>THEN</strong></em> Detroit VS. Minnesota at 6 PM Eastern. Will someone explain to me how to watch all of these games?</p>
<p>The Coup-de Grassi in all of  this &#8230; not only are they stealing Hockey Day in Canada but they are putting Hockey Day in America against <em><strong>Canada&#8217;s Heritage Classic; THEIR version of the outdoor WINTER CLASSIC (which we stole). Wait for it &#8230;. ON VERSUS which NBC OWNS! </strong></em>What&#8217;s a hockey fan to do? And oh how rude to Canada &#8230;!</p>
<p>Holy Sparkly Flying Dancing Unicorn Out My Butt! Does NBC have no Shame? Don&#8217;t answer that. While I am normally the first to criticize Canada because I do not quite feel the same why about our neighbor to the north as Pants and Chuck, visiting as often as I do, this is simply unacceptable. It is poorly conceived and makes no sense. It&#8217;s bad for Hockey and not a good PR move for the NHL. Why not tie in WITH HOCKEY DAY IN CANADA &#8230; oh wait, <em><strong>THAT</strong></em> would make sense.</p>
