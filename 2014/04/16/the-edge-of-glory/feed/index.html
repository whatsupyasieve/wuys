		<description><![CDATA[I really have to be faithful to my Pens. I&#039;m old enough to be the mother of ALL of them, but I still call Sid Boyfriend #1 and James Neal Boyfriend #2 (for embarassing reasons that will remain unwritten here) and try not to be a fairweather fan. Their first win last night was hard-fought, and they better get even better if they&#039;re going to advance....which brings me to the sad truth I am struggling to face, and that is that I&#039;m not sure they can beat the Blackhawks or the Bruins if it comes to that, and then the West....  I just don&#039;t know.  But hope springeth eternal.  I read an article yesterday that had Rangers winning the whole thing, so what the heck do I know?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think there&#039;s a decent chance that the Ducks underestimate the Stars and the Stars take advantage.  It&#039;s a longshot, but when the Ducks are bad, they are really bad (the game I went to a couple of weeks ago was PAINFUL).  Plus they aren&#039;t very deep on defense.  I still pick them to win the series, but I wouldn&#039;t be shocked if Dallas won.  Also, more Benn brothers, please.

My big upset pick is the Blue Jackets.  They are pesky (since that seems to be the trendy hockey adjective these days) as hell, and the Penguins have been, well, out of deference to Pants (even though she dogs my Rangers), I&#039;m gonna leave it at &quot;not great&quot; in the playoffs the past couple of years.  The Islanders almost beat them last year and the year before that was that... whatever the hell that was... between them &#038; Philly.  Plus, Flower = sieve in the playoffs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If for any other reason, I love this post for ALL THE GIFS!! Gif(t)s indeed. They had me laughing.

Since I live close-ish to Columbus, OH and I&#039;m not a Penguins fan, I&#039;m praying for an amazing upset in that series in seven games. I doubt it will happen, but at the very least, I&#039;m hoping CBJ gives Pittsburgh a run for their money.]]></description>
