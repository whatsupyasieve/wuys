		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m petrified about the playoffs.  I&#039;m so stinking excited for the playoff beards.  

I&#039;m especially excited to see how Jamie Benn handles the playoffs and the playoff beards.  He&#039;s my new hockey crush and it&#039;s all WUYS&#039;s fault :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Playoffs.....the most wonderful/awful/glorious/hateful time of the year. When you temporarily suspend friendships and warn your coworkers not to do/say/think anything wrong around you, because your rage cannot be contained. I can&#039;t decide whether I love the regular season more for the consistency of hockey, or the playoffs, for the payoff of the Cup. Gah....the STRESS. It&#039;s all good though - I&#039;ve got my bourbon, ice cream, pasta and Fiona Apple. I&#039;m GOOD TO GO.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah, the first WUYS playoff beard post of the season.  You ladies always do us proud.  So much fabulous here: Prust worshipping, Stammer as Simba and the Wolverine/meerkat Kazer combo.  Genius!  And then you had to go and wish food poisoning on my Rangers.  How can you not want to see more of Lundqvist&#039;s manscaped marvelousness and enjoy the trials &#038; tribulations of Hagelin&#039;s valiant but fruitless effort to grow anything but peach fuzz (see what I did there)?]]></description>
