		<description><![CDATA[I wholeheartedly support Lindsay&#039;s Habs fan blood plan.  Anyone who cheers at the injury of a player is a disgrace to hockey (and sport in general, really).  

And I can&#039;t believe I&#039;m saying this, but I was MORE enraged by that no-goal call in the TBL/MON game than I was at a Rangers loss I paid good money to witness in person.  At least the Rangers have no one to blame but themselves (there were a couple of weak calls, but 53 minutes of TERRIBLE hockey lost them that game).  The Lightning had the tying goal (and who knows what kind of resulting momentum swing) yanked away from them like a shady dentist pulling out your teeth without novocaine.  And then right after that they let Price spend 2 minutes at the bench with an alleged skate issue during an icing?  Just awful.

Between that game, Lucic only being find 10 cents for that groin shot, the hit on Backes &#038; the taunt, it&#039;s been a pretty grim week of playoff hockey.  I&#039;m super happy for #Lumbus, though.  Congrats on your first ever playoff win, kids.  I&#039;m just going to focus on that until things get less ugly around here. I need a hockey hug.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a Habs fan I was mortified by how the crowd behaved after the Stamkos injury. I&#039;m glad he&#039;s okay.

Also, I totally disagree with the no-goal call. It feels good to win but we don&#039;t want to win like that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That last gif describes all my emotions of this weekend. Seriously, the Bruins losing Game 1 and the Pens first win are the only good takeaways. Steven, I worry about your brain. Oh, and Pants you said it best last season - after Canadiens fans cheering about Stamkos getting kneed in the head: ZAMBONI THE ICE WITH THE BLOOD OF HABS FANS.]]></description>
