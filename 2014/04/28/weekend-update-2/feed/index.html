		<description><![CDATA[There are In-N-Out Burgers in Dallas :-) Whole slew of them.

The game last night was such a heartbreaker, you could sense the Stars were gonna lose it at the end of the third. Couldn&#039;t handle the Ducks pressure :-(  Oh well, got my season tix for next year and can&#039;t wait!! Goligoski&#039;s hit on Perry was right in front of me, my whole section went nuts. A guy in the section next to me started the &quot;Perry Sucks&quot; chant, which my parents said could be heard clearly on the Stars broadcast.

Also, a gem from Razor Reaugh...he said Perry reminds him of Eddie Haskill from &quot;Leave it to Beaver&quot;. He&#039;s deceptively polite. Love it! Razor&#039;s the best!! Go Stars!!!!

P.S. Thank you for the Pietrangelo pic in the opener. I didn&#039;t know you could find those pics on Pinterest, and I promptly lost an hour of my day looking for more! Internet for the win.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To quote My Fair Lady, I&#039;ve become accustomed to Jamie Benn&#039;s face (and hair and beautiful, shirtless, ping-pong-playing bod), and even though I didn&#039;t care about the Stars until about two months ago, they became my little engines that might!  I just wanted better for them and what happened to them instead was just the worst.  

And Chuck, I didn&#039;t understand the Corey Perry hate before.  Now I definitely get it.  (Adding insult to injury, Ryan Getzlaf reminds me of my jerk-of-an-ex-boyfriend.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had Ducks in 4 on my bracket so seriously well done Stars. And thank you for adding Texas to my hockey road trip bucket list which is already threatening to bankrupt me. And it seems Jamie Benn is of the Patrick Sharp School of Protecting Your Mystery.If he comes home for the summer, I hope he brings Tyler and I&#039;ll use my best Six Degrees of Being From Victoria powers to find out where he hangs out and... Run in completely the other direction because that is how I roll.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m pretty sure my head exploded about a million times during the Stars/Ducks series. My only solace this morning is watching replay of Goligowski laying that massive hit on Perry. And pics of the boys, of course. Is it October yet?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That pic of the Benn brothers (and the post-game glow from beating the Flyers) is the only thing keeping me from flying into a rage.  The officiating in the Wild/Avs game &#038; the Stars/Ducks game was SO atrocious that I thought every capillary in my eye might burst.

I don&#039;t know how you got that pic since Jordie&#039;s Instagram is private, but I would like to buy your sources a round of drinks.  I actually felt my cheeks flush when I looked at that.]]></description>
