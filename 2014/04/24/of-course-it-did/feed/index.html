		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had two hockey themed conversations today; one with the sister (who doesn&#039;t get it) and the other with Canadian Surgeon about flinging octopus (we had to explain that at length to the confused mob in the room) and why he may never forgive TBL for going out against the f-ing Habs. He questioned Stamkos&#039; play and I had to remind him about the broken leg (sorry everyone).

This, considering we are in Scotland, that well known hockey heartland!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Honestly, I think it&#039;s okay that the Pens are going into the 5th game 2-2. Look at what has happened in this series every time a team has had a 3-1 lead: Boom! The other team wins 4-3. Who knows… the same thing may have held true for games won, not just goals. The way I see it, Fleury just saved them. Yep, I&#039;m just going to go with that theory...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I’ve also had it with all the media always coming down so hard on Fleury.  I feel sooo bad for Fleury because if the Pens lose, it’s all his fault.  Yeah, he should not be out of the net.  What was he thinking? TSN analyst Jamie McLennan figures Fleury was feeling confident having been playing pretty well during the game so he had the confidence to go clear it for his guys but he had the most unfortunate luck of a bouncing puck.  BUT all the Pens skaters were puck watching and not in position defensively.  Ugh!  Even Aaron Ward who has been the hardest on Fleury admitted he can’t fault Fleury too much on the last two goals.  I just really hope he can put that aside and play solid like he has been so far.  Bottom line is that all the Pens need to step it up.  Crosby, Malkin, I am waiting… #pensinsix]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m going to be traumatized by 4-3/3-4 scores for the rest of my life.  Flower ABSOLUTELY needs to stay in his net, but I agree completely with what you said: he&#039;s holding the team together and he/they/we all need to remain calm and be positive.  (I&#039;m mostly addressing that little pep talk to myself.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is the first game where we actually can point our fingers at Flower and go &quot;YOU!&quot; with judgmental looks on our faces. Within that last 50 seconds I actually thought the Pens could walk away with the win, and then that goal happened. I sighed and made a mental note that the series would return to Pittsburgh tied 2-2. The emotional roller coaster of this series will actually be the death of me, one way or the other.]]></description>
