		<description><![CDATA[Aww man.  I read the article this morning and yeah, okay, I&#039;m kind of hopeful.  Between the suspension, the call-out by Stewart, the AskNeal fiasco, the Team Canada snub, I just kept thinking that he has to realize that things are not okay.  Sure, I&#039;ll miss his little &quot;what is violence anyway&quot; quips but I&#039;m tired of Nealer the Sassy Shithead.  I&#039;d much rather have him actually playing, far into June and playing good, tough, clean hockey.  

(I also feel like James needs to spend more time with Paulie, who seems so calm and centered and focused.  They can wear glasses and talk about their feelings and eat breakfast together.  Maybe do some centering sun salutations?)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[BATMAN. His shirt - and that voice - practically declares it so, right? 
ALSO - I&#039;d almost forgotten what that ginger beard looked like, like a figment of my imagination washed away with the devastation of last year and what...no. NO. I won&#039;t go there. It&#039;s a whole new world, a whole new playoffs, a whole new playoffs. Let&#039;s do this, Pens.]]></description>
