		<description><![CDATA[I am 100% cool with this MSL situation now. Don&#039;t need you, and look what&#039;s happening now, 26 - plenty of points for Callahan while you&#039;re up there for the Blue Shirts. UGH. 

As for Toews...cue the panic attacks. I know how Alison feels about Orpik and after that hit, I&#039;m with her. I&#039;m 100% for him to get a deal in Edmonton or Phoenix if JT ain&#039;t healed up for April 16. Come playoffs, you don&#039;t want to know me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a ball of stress right now.  And I sometimes think Dan Potash is my spirit animal: being tortured by hockey players but always coming back for more.  Sometimes I hate everyone too, Dan.  (Especially the Flyers.)

Maybe Dan Potash and I both just need to watch Jamie Benn play some ping pong.  So soothing.  So aesthetically pleasing.]]></description>
