		<description><![CDATA[I was so wound up after the Pens game that I ended up watching the end of the Blackhawks-Blues game AND the Stars-Ducks game, which meant I was up waaay past my bedtime.  Pants and Alison, please continue wearing the game 1 outfit.  Please.

When Nealer was getting feisty last night, I was shouting &quot;Remember Matt Cooke!!!&quot; at my computer.  And then I find out during the intermission that Matt Cooke is back to his old ways.  So disappointing.

I find the discrepancy between the Brothers Benn&#039;s beards (alliteration!) hilarious and amazing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know people need to sell newspapers, get page clicks, and make their TV &quot;analysis&quot; all dramatic and such, but Sid has 4A and Geno has 3A, so this &quot;they aren&#039;t producing so the Pens can&#039;t win&quot; narrative is eye-roll inducing to me. They&#039;re getting chances. Eventually, the puck is going to start going in the net for them. And the PP can&#039;t stay dry forever. But until then, I&#039;m happy for Nisky, BSutts, Brian Gibbons (get well soon!), random defensemen to be scoring. All season: &quot;THE PENS NEED MORE SECONDARY SCORING!&quot; -- now that they have it: &quot;SID AND GENO NEED TO BE BETTER!&quot;

Also, general shout out to MAF for being awesome and giving them a chance to win every game.

It&#039;s quite amazing the clarity and calm that comes with a good night&#039;s sleep, isn&#039;t it?]]></description>
