		<description><![CDATA[The Kings-Ducks game was so exciting!  I was at a bar on Saturday night for a graduation get together, and there were approximately two other people in our group who cared about hockey.  Normally I&#039;m the lone hockey fan so it was really exciting.

Sidenote: The graduation party took place in Madison, WI, and this past weekend was the weekend of the Mifflin St block party which is now just drunken undergrads wandering around downtown.  As we (the 30+ year olds) were wading through drunken undergrads, I kept thinking of Patrick Kane.  It&#039;s so nice that we&#039;re all talking about his backhand instead of his Cinco de Mayo celebrations.]]></description>
