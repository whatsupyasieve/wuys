		<description><![CDATA[It always rubs me the wrong way when &quot;fans&quot; don&#039;t watch the playoffs because their team is eliminated or didn&#039;t make the playoffs.  That is wrong on so many levels.  These playoffs have been amazing.  While my team is on the brink of elimination (NYR), I will be rooting for the Bruins.  What is there left to say about Bergeron?  A hockey god.  A real man.  A warrior.  And, sweet to look at too. Wish I were from Boston. You are sooooo lucky to have him.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, did you write anything after that Bergy pic?  Brains turned to mush and leaked out my ears...or maybe that was my ovaries turning to mush...

Unrelatedly, how unfair was it for EA to pit Perfect Patrice against everyone&#039;s favorite new Tumblr addict, Swedish Prince Erik Karlsson?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Hawks/Wild game wasn&#039;t bonkers, it was a giant snooze. The Wild were just slightly less skating on molasses than the Hawks then the Hawks just kinda gave up. *sad trombone* 

Looking forward to a more exciting Game 4 on Friday that I get to watch in it&#039;s entirety whilst eating takeout as is my Friday tradition. Actually my Friday tradition is eating take out and watching Reign on PVR, but I will make an exception #BecauseItsTheCup.]]></description>
