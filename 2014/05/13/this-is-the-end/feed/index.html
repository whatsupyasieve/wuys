		<description><![CDATA[Dear Pants, I just wanted to say Thank You for this blog. I am german and, well, try being a hockey fan over here... and a Pens fan on top! There is literally no one else around who understands me. The most I got in the beginning from my very willing family: &quot;Hockey? Oh, why don&#039;t you go see a game of the Kölner Haie (Cologne Sharks)?&quot; (I know NOTHING about the Haie. Plus, european hockey is a whole other story) So, the internet it is. Thank god for tumblr and especially your blog. I only read this post today as I had to overcome my post-season funk first. But it is so good, so very good, and so well written, and it lifts me up and reels me in again and gives me feels. I&#039;m going to save up and maybe in a year or two I can finally hop over and see the Pens live, that would be so great. Until then I live vicariously through you and your blog. So do me a favor, please? Never stop!! *hugs* (btw, I love that you are over thirty (as me) and married and NOT one of the many many baby fangirls on tumblr)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I didn&#039;t know how to say what I was feeling, but you did. (Except for the cheering for the Capitals part - I don&#039;t get it. And I don&#039;t *completely* hate the Rangers. But anyway.) I wore all black to work today, and my coworkers knew better than to ask me about anything hockey today. It&#039;s nice to have other women who get hockey...none of my friends here in Nebraska do (there&#039;s good hockey here, just that none of my friends follow it). Keep up the awesome work, ladies. You rock.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am a leafs fan because this is the team I grew up with, but in my heart and in reality, my team is the Pittsburgh Penguins.  Being a Leafs fan, you grow up with disappointment, but the Penguins give you hope every year. It hurts that they lost because you have such high hopes every year.  Granted, this year I didn’t have much confidence they would go far.  But it wasn’t meant to be.    Better luck next year is the common phrase this time of year.  If the Habs don’t win tonight, that’s it.  I’ve lost interest in these playoffs.  A Leafs fan supporting the Habs is almost unheard of but I have actually always liked them (especially Price and Subban).  Plus I hate the Boston Bruins so, so much!  Go Habs Go!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So well said. It was tough to watch and part of me is relieved that it&#039;s just over and we can move on and focus on the future but the bigger part of me wants to still be in there fighting tooth and nail. I love this site and you ladies are always a highlight of my week. Thank you &#060;3]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Pants! Much love back to you! Today it was at the car dealership when a guy asked me what was so important while I was reading your blog. I said &quot;the Penguins losing&quot; and he was like really they lost? I just have to remember you guys are there for us in times like these even if the rest of the world doesn&#039;t understand! I love any team that will show so-called MAGIC during the playoffs so poor Pens, they just don&#039;t have it this year. Hey, we always have summer golf pics and if we get really bored, more recipe postings!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is my first read of your blog.. thanks because this hockey fan will chase people down with team license plates just to talk hockey.  I was on I-95 heading out of FLA after going to the Frozen Four in Tampa - GO FERRIS STATE - and saw a plate from Ontario with Leaf Logo on the plates just like my Carolina Hurricane logo&#039;s state plate.. :-)  Actually ended up parking next to them at the rest area.. and talked hockey.  As a woman hockey fan - it is nice to read actual hockey stuff - not the silly stuff - about hockey. I will be watching what happens to your Pens (sorry was cheering for Rangers) during the off season as closely as I will be watching my Canes and their changes.  I do love Jussi and Brandon and will always appreciate Craig Adams for his contributions to 2006.. the best year ever.  So until next season - GO HAWKS !!  #IsItOctoberYet]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, I know that not everyone wanted him gone. But, I follow quite a few Rangers fans on Twitter &#038; saw a TON of &quot;Use a Buyout on Richie!&quot; RT&#039;d onto my timeline last summer. What aggravates me isn&#039;t that they wanted him to be bought out, but that TODAY those same people love him again! 

Regarding Marc Staal - if it WAS only 1 dumb play, it might be a different story. However, it was not only once. It was all series. And that&#039;s all I&#039;m going to say about it.  YES, James Neal pisses me off with his stupidity - ESPECIALLY because he&#039;s an elite sniper when he keeps his shit together. Sadly, that&#039;s less often than any of us would prefer! :/ 

At any rate, Good Luck to your boys. They wanted it more and earned it - that&#039;s all there is to it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bravo! And thanks for all that, now and in future. As a lifelong Canucks/Mariners/Penguins/Twins fan, you have beautifully summed why I stick with sports and more importantly: the teams, players and fans year after year after year. I also don&#039;t understand burning the team after a playoff exit, let&#039;s hope the damage is minimal -- look at the great example Vancouver set this season on what NOT to do...
Have a great summer, and if you are ever in Seattle I&#039;ll buy you a beer at the Angry Beaver (Hockey bar).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I feel you Pants!  Heartbreak is part of this game... and while I&#039;m sad the Pens did not lofty the Cup this year,  I&#039;m so glad they can breathe again and maybe enjoy themselves. Hockey is about fun too,  those poor guys had the joy of the game taken away from them by greedy media and unintentionally coddled fans. As a Sabres Fan first,  I am experienced at calling for change and then regretting it.  I hope they don&#039;t blow up the Pens because expectations are unrealistic.. beware what you wish for!

Oh and for the record,  I&#039;ve got beat on the hate: I&#039;ve hated the Bruins for at least 35 years!  Go Habs!]]></description>
