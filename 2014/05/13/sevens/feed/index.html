		<description><![CDATA[Pretty sure I speak for ALL of us when I say that I&#039;m as nervous as a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs right now! And it&#039;s only going to get worse. My God, I LOVE my Penguins &#038; I&#039;m praying with all I have that we see the ones from Games 2, 3, &#038; 4 step onto the ice tonight &#038; OWN the first 10 minutes of the first!!! 

Seems like Sid&#039;s FINALLY able to grow some sorta-respectable facial hair...Yay for Cappy! :D

Say it with me, ladies: Whatever it takes, we walk together.
                                   Buckle up, baby - are you kidding me?!?!?
                                   LET&#039;S GO PENS!!!!]]></description>
