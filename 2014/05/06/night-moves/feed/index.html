		<description><![CDATA[Congratulations, Pants.  I&#039;m happy for you, but the 48 hours that consisted of Sunday &#038; Monday was pretty much the worst 48 hours of this entire hockey season for me.  The Rangers lost (and scored NO F-ING GOALS ON FLOWER) 2 games in a row, and the Amerks (my hometown AHL team) were eliminated from the playoffs in a game where the reffing was, to but it nicely, an abomination.

The only thing keeping me from not committing hari kari with a hockey stick is this post that I found on Tumblr (god bless you, Tumblr):  http://shawsome65.tumblr.com/post/73973685547/hockey-players-arms-appreciation-post]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agreed!  For me, that pass was more exciting than the goal.  I feel like he put all of his heart, soul, hopes, dreams, fear of letting down Sid, etc. into that pass.  Big day, Bortsy!  (No, I&#039;m not tearing up.  It&#039;s just my seasonal allergies.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That pass from Borts was just plain FILTHY!!! And it earned him his first ever HNIC towel! Yay, Borts!!! :) 

Said it last night - the Kings are looking like they did during their 2012 run. Can they sustain?  Don&#039;t know, but it&#039;ll sure be fun watching....because it&#039;s not the Pens! Ha ha]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re on, Angie!  Warning: I am married to a professionally trained chef and so I sometimes have help in the kitchen.  He usually watches me and laughs for a while, then kicks me out and cooks it himself.  I&#039;m a winner either way!

We also made this last night, for lunches this week: http://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/browse-all-recipes/steak-cumin-lime-yogurt-00100000116115/]]></description>
