		<description><![CDATA[That picture of Sidney Crosby and Robert Bortuzzo at the bar. How does anyone even know that&#039;s Robert from the back?  They are rumored, I repeat rumored, to have jetted across the pond to Spain for a week &quot;boys only&quot; trip.

		<description><![CDATA[19-year-old Olli Maatta!!!!  (At some point, he&#039;s going to turn 20 and then what will we call him?  20-year-old Olli Maatta just doesn&#039;t have the same ring to it.)  How smooth is he?  Smooth like buttah (and all the rest of the ingredients needed in ice cream.)

I&#039;m still hurt and harumphy but this post makes it better.]]></description>
