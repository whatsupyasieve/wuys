		<description><![CDATA[Another very fair skinned blonde here!  Yes, beige is an awful color for me.  Black clothing is very, very tough to give up though. :/

Paulie definitely has a professorial vibe--there&#039;s a picture floating around of him in a grey collared sweater that&#039;s also a great, English professor look for him.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The English professor vibe counteracts the potential porn-stache creepiness. I give him credit for realizing that grey is his best neutral. As a fellow very fair skinned blonde, I only realized it last year when a friend told me I look dead in black and overly beige in beige :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This weekend definitely made me realize that although I like the Blackhawks (darn you Jonathan Toews for being such a great, clutch captain!  And little P Kane for being so charming!), they&#039;re not reeeaaaally my team.  I&#039;m only mildly interested, as an outsider.  In general, I&#039;m feeling rather uninspired--as made obvious by this uninspired comment.  Blaaah.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just don&#039;t know if I can get emotionally invested again. I mean, the adorable Habs are doomed if Price is hurt, the Blackhawks feels like bandwagon-jumping and I absolutely can&#039;t stand LA or NY. 

I guess I&#039;ll just get my hockey fix by watching old games and lurking on Tumblr hoping for new Paul Martin holding a baby and/or having a mustache pics. I like what he did when he shaved off the playoff beard: http://instagram.com/p/oHiZGOgoGJ/]]></description>
