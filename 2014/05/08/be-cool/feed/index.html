		<description><![CDATA[That fourth Pens goal might have been the worst goal the Rangers have let in all season.  Definitely top 3.  So, so painful.  The only positives to being at the game were 1-footage of me made it into the pre-game montage they play on the jumbotron... woo!!! (I totally should&#039;ve left after that one shining moment); and 2-not having to suffer the additional indignity of listening to Pierre.

A terrible effort all around by the Rangers.  Not an excuse, but I think Henrik is hurt.  Throughout the game, in between whistles, his body language was very slow and awkward.  I hope it&#039;s not serious.  As for the rest of the team?  I think they just patently refuse to let me be happy.  I&#039;m sure that&#039;s it.

I&#039;m going to see Cher &#038; Cyndi Lauper tonight because I can&#039;t bear to watch Game 5 live.  I&#039;ll DVR it so I can fast forward through the painful parts.  This girl just wants (and needs) to have fun.]]></description>
