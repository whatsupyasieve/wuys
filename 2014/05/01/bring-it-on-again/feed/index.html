		<description><![CDATA[Hitchhiker&#039;s Reference!!  

Last night, I imagined Giroux&#039;s disappointment and did a little &quot;Suck it Giroux!&quot; celebration dance.  (It was very reminiscent of Meg Ryan&#039;s little air-punch-y dance in You&#039;ve Got Mail.&quot;)

Bring on the high blood pressure and stress eating!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I, too, giggled at the Nino line AND the headline! Classic stuff, Pants! :D

I tweeted a sad about Gabe the Babe&#039;s beard going bye bye last night &#038; taqged you - did you see it? This year&#039;s edition was more than a little Ginger-ish, no? Regardless, it sure was pretty &#038; made him look older (in other words, I didn&#039;t feel like such a playpen-robber for calling him, &quot;Gabe the Babe&quot;! Hah!!).

Agreed with both Jana &#038; wish: Giggling at the sad panda &#038; carbs comment, too! I can TOTALLY picture Bryz&#039; tiara &#038; Coyle pouring with his pinky in the air!! Hahahahahaha]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pants, I&#039;m going to be giggling all day at that panda photo: Come back with carbs.

I&#039;m still giggling.

Being on east coast time, I don&#039;t see a lot of western conference games, so I definitely didn&#039;t see the end of any games 7s last night. I can&#039;t get over how loud that Wild OT goal was. I rewatched that Wild clip multiple times just to hear it again and again. &quot;CLANK!!&quot; As a hockey fan, that is such a great sound. 

So Round 2: Let&#039;s go Hawks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Nino Niederreiter, who sounds like an imaginary friend at a tea party, had two goals including the OT winner.&quot;

hahahahahahahahahahahaha

Pants, we may be mortal enemies for Round 2, but that was priceless.  I can totally see Nino, Coyle, Parise, Harding &#038; Bryz (who would be wearing a tiara, of course) sitting in tiny chairs around a table having cookies and fake tea.]]></description>
