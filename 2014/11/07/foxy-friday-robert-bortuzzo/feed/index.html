		<description><![CDATA[1. That pic with the Nordstrom caption... *swoon*
2. Clearly I need to watch the Sandlot, if Jamie Benn &#038; Rob Bortuzzo are such big fans. Think they&#039;d come over for movie night? I&#039;ll get gourmet popcorn, boys.
3. Must. Get. Summer place. In Thunder Bay. Dear lord, that is the land of milk and hotness, er, honey.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not going to lie, if I watched hockey only for looks I would make demands that Borts rock no helmet and the camera stay on him. I have some ridiculous crush on him that causes me to become giddier than 10 year old me looking at Justin Timberlake. 
Now that I&#039;ve expressed my love for his face, let me just say reaction faces for everything is so true. 

You guys are the best! This cheered me up tonight :)]]></description>
