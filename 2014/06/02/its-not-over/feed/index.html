		<description><![CDATA[In this particular series, I&#039;m rooting for the Rangers, but also without enthusiasm.  Some some weird reason, I like Kreider.  And do like Lundqvist, as well.  I do recognize the downside of NY, as in their fans are so &quot;in your face&quot;, especially if they beat your team in your home arena.

Full disclosure: I&#039;m a Caps fan who&#039;s second favorite team is the Blues.  I regard the Rangers as the &quot;lesser of two evils&quot; compared to the Kings.  And glad the Blackhawks and Pens are both out.  Admit my dislike of the Pens is at odds with one of the main bloggers here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love hockey....so I&#039;m in.  ALL IN for the Kings.  I can&#039;t justify rooting for a team that beat my Pens.  No way- still VERY BITTER about that loss.  So Doughty and the Kings will hopefully kick some major butt.  
Keep the blog up, though....I love reading!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t really have a favorite in this final.
Was born in raised in NY, so would be kinda neat if the Rangers won.

On the other hand, have seen a lot of the Kings players in the minors (AHL team, Manchester Monarchs) so from that perspective it&#039;s fun to watch how far they&#039;ve progressed.

I&#039;m just going to have to watch and see if I wind up rooting for one team more than the other. But, I can say I am rooting for good hockey. It probably won&#039;t match the same level as the Hawks-Kings series, but hope one team doesn&#039;t totally walk, er, skate over the other.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with you Wish. And I have to say this is the first post on this blog that I&#039;ve been sorely disappointed by, as well as all the &quot;I&#039;m done&quot; replies. I&#039;ve been a die hard Bruins fan for years, and yes it sucks that they were eliminated. But you know what? There&#039;s still (potentially great) hockey being played. Will I wake up early on the nights I have to work to watch any of the finals games? Like I did for the any Bruins games? No. But I&#039;ll watch them when I can, and look up the scores/highlights when I can&#039;t. I&#039;ll be kinda rooting for the Rangers, partly because I remember when they last won it all, but if there&#039;s great hockey it&#039;ll be enough for me. Hockey is hockey, and the Finals are the Finals, regardless if your team is in it to win it or not. But this eh fuck it attitude from people who claim to be hockey fans?? I don&#039;t get it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am . . . indifferent mostly.  I&#039;ll watch, but I&#039;ll mostly watch for specific players instead of teams.  I&#039;d like Richards and Carter to win again because I like it when things are rubbed in Homers face, I like observing Jarrett Stoll and Erin Andrew&#039;s relationship on twitter, Drew Doughty fell over the boards last night and it made me laugh.  Darryl Sutter&#039;s press conferences are a thing of beauty.

As far as the Rangers are concerned at one point I wanted the Ginger Staal to get to win the cup so he wouldn&#039;t feel left out on the sod farm, but then he went apeshit on everyone&#039;s brains and I kind of got over that.  I haven&#039;t forgiven MSL for acting like a spoiled child.  And last but not least, really the only piece of redemption for NYR - Dominic Moore&#039;s story makes me want good things for him.  

But lord - I don&#039;t really care.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not even. My team was eliminated early on. But appreciate the quality of play not a name and lackluster performance. Next you&#039;ll want us to evaluate penalty minutes to make other people feel bad. Nope my season ended in March. But thanks for your opinion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a huge Pens fan and have been huge-disappointed-sad since their elimination and the aftermath. That being said, I&#039;m still watching every game. I had a blast watching the Kings/Blackhawks series, because it was just wow. Unlike many here, I was hoping for a soul-crushing loss for the Blackhawks since my second-fave team is the Blues, and I got my wish. 

As far as the final, I&#039;m actually cheering for the Rangers, even though I think they have slightly more than a snowball&#039;s chance in hell of winning (although if Henrik Lundqvist plays out of his mind and wins the Conn Smythe I think they could surprise people). I&#039;ve never had the hatred toward the Rangers that some people have. I tend to feel better about my team being bumped out of the playoffs if the team that bumps them ends up winning the whole thing (unless I totally hate them - I will NEVER cheer for the Flyers, for example). I&#039;ve also been a fan of Carl Hagelin since his college days, am a fan of Lundqvist, and have a soft spot for undersized forwards that work their asses off (see Marty St. Louis and Mats Zuccarello). 

TL;DR: I&#039;m still watching. I&#039;m a hockey addict. I&#039;m gonna need a 12 step program once the SCF ends.]]></description>

We get it - since everyone&#039;s favorites (Chicago &#038; Pittsburgh) didn&#039;t make it, the whole world is in mourning.  This smacks of &quot;if I can&#039;t win, I&#039;m gonna take my toys and go home.&quot;  I guess I shouldn&#039;t be surprised, but I expected better from people.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Iâ€™m out since the Habs were eliminated.  I was only mildly interested in the Chicago/L.A. series. I know, I know, both teams were playing A+ hockey and arguably the best series with the two best teams, but hey, thatâ€™s what happens when your favourite teams arenâ€™t playing.  Although, technically the Habs arenâ€™t really my favourite team, I was still rooting for them being the last Canadian team standing.  I want L.A. to win the Cup, but just like Pants, I wonâ€™t be seething with anger if the Rangers win.   I love hockey but itâ€™s hard to get into a game when your own team gets knocked out.  Iâ€™ll probably check in occasionally and see what the score is but other than that and the final game, meh.  On a positive note, my social calendar has freed up!]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iâ€™m out since the Habs were eliminated.  I was only mildly interested in the Chicago/L.A. series. I know, I know, both teams were playing A+ hockey and arguably the best series with the two best teams, but hey, thatâ€™s what happens when your favourite teams arenâ€™t playing.  Although, technically the Habs arenâ€™t really my favourite team, I was still rooting for them being the last Canadian team standing.  I want L.A. to win the Cup, but just like Pants, I wonâ€™t be seething with anger if the Rangers win.   I love hockey but itâ€™s hard to get into a game when your own team gets knocked out.  Iâ€™ll probably check in occasionally and see what the score is but other than that and the final game, meh.  On a positive note, my social calendar has freed up!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t agree with you more, wish! My Pens are done, but I&#039;m SUCH a hockey addict that I&#039;m still all-in on the Final! I&#039;m rooting for the Kings, but I&#039;ll be watching every game. Because it&#039;s the Cup! :)]]></description>
