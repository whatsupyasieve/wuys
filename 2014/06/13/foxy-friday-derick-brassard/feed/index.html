		<description><![CDATA[I think everyone in the WORLD knows how much I detest anything with the words New and York in them... but, this guy... this team stacked with endless foxy fridays... I had never cheered so hard in my life for a team I couldn&#039;t care less for, than I did on Wednesday. Let&#039;s hear it for Marty because god knows that&#039;s why I want that team to win. #VermontPride #UVM but Derick Brassard... Here I was, thinking my forbidden crushes on Chris Krieder and Derek Stepan were low because they&#039;re much (3 and 4 years) younger than I am.. but Brass... we&#039;re only a few months apart.. albeit, I&#039;m older... but, that&#039;s something I can stand behind... I heard Chiarelli is looking to trade Marchand... just putting it out there that I won&#039;t be disappointed if we get rid of our little ball o&#039; hate for someone a little more foxy.... Does it count that my middle and last names are French? Think that has any weight with Brass?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know a lot of people like the Rangers, and most people know that, like you, I&#039;m a Pens fan. So I&#039;ll just say that I could not have appreciated the James Neal fight clip any more than I did. I was scrolling along, fingers crossed, waiting for you to throw it in there. And you did it so politely, too. Props.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s Friday the 13th and a full moon, that will cancel out everything about this post, and the fact that I begrudgingly enjoyed it as much you did writing it. Because I&#039;m with you on the NO rangers thing, plus a weird love for CBJ (they&#039;re my closest geographical team!), so I have extra resentment of all players who used to be on CBJ that are now Rangers.]]></description>
