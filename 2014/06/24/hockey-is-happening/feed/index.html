		<description><![CDATA[I have so many thoughts!  First, dang, I missed you guys!  This made my day.

I always get confused about the dress code for these little afternoon events.  You have Matt Duchene looking like he&#039;s on a beer run and then Pietrangelo is sporting a look that would be very appropriate for a casual lunch with his girlfriend and her parents.  I do wonder if Jamie Benn is wearing the cardigan because he&#039;s worried about his tattoo inciting riots again on tumblr...?

Carey Price.  Your beard is good.  Tazer, go to Nantucket and be with your people.  Embrace the Nantucket reds.

That Giroux video and the entire Hartnell trade is making me feel bad for Giroux and that is... confusing.  I cannot have any wiggle room in my feelings for him.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Where did soccer mom go?  Tavares could dress like this and go out in public and 9 times out of 10, I&#039;d walk right past him without recognizing him.  That aside, he&#039;s kind of hot when he dresses his age (I&#039;m finally catching on, Pants!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So AFTER this week we are free from being emotionally invested in hockey until September, yes? The are really wrapping it up with a 1-2 punch this year that I am choosing to take personally.

&quot;Hey Jessica, remember when you went to the NHL Awards in the Jay Mohr era before Toews was fun? Oh, no? How about we bring half of Team Canada to your doorstep, but on a Monday while you&#039;re at work?&quot;]]></description>
