		<description><![CDATA[I, too, loathe the Rangers. Since that fateful game 7 in April I&#039;ve been taunted by diehard and bandwagon Rags fans alike. Unfortunately, living in my region of the country leaves me susceptible to many Rangers updates, further fueling the fires of hate... But this was too good to pass up. Zucs in those shorts... good lord. Kreider is probably at the top of my list of players I loathe, but I have to admit, he has it going on. Thank God Ginger Staal has on a tee!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[need to remind myself - I also loathe the Rangers... I think this is their way of trying to get us all to love them... I am happy to help apply spf 50 - lord knows I own and use that. Aveeno has lotion sunscreen, so it doesn&#039;t smell like you&#039;re wearing sunscreen.. maybe I should go to LA and help them.... ? NO. BAD. Casey.]]></description>
