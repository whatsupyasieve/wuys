		<description><![CDATA[Excellent review as always. The Crosby-fest was raving on in my apartment, despite my boyfriend&#039;s disinterest. Also, Cuba Gooding, Jr. caught a lot of flack for his bit, but I found it so awkwardly refreshing. So many of these nice Canadian boys are even-keel and it was nice to see someone totally unhinged for once.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Remember that time I saw PK on the sidewalk outside of Maple Leafs Gardens and literally ran into the Loblaws because I panicked and didn&#039;t know what to do? If only I could have contained myself I could have experienced all of that hilariousness and charm IN REAL LIFE. I kick myself every day.

Someone give that man a daytime talk show and make Sid a weekly guest, please.

		<description><![CDATA[Let&#039;s discuss these Valentino heels, shall we? While they&#039;re not a new thing, they seem to be the right of WAG passage at $1,000 a pop (no joke) - but I&#039;d give the award to Toews&#039; girlfriend. While Bergeron&#039;s wife&#039;s dress is LOVELY (I&#039;d snap that up in a minute), the contrast with the colour...not my favourite. She might have gone with the orange Valentino stud heels, or a peep toe like Giroux&#039;s girlfriend had. Still, snaps all around for how happy and shiny everyone looked. 

Pants, if you and Chuck are attending the awards next year can I tag along to act as your Joan Rivers fashion critic of all the fancy people?]]></description>
