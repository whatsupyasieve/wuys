		<description><![CDATA[It was SUCH a confusing and exciting morning.  On one hand, of course I&#039;m cheering for Team USA. But on the other, as a Pens fans with a healthy appreciation for Jonathan Toews, I&#039;m feeling all muddled.  Geno!  Kuni!  Olli!  TAZER.  Ack.

I have decided that when I&#039;m not watching games, I&#039;ll be watching Miracle on repeat.  And maybe the second Mighty Ducks movie.  Quack. Quack. Quack.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Little Joe rocked the ginger beard for his country! And Kessel Celebration Face is....well...something. 

Seeing Evgeni Malkin&#039;s name spelled &quot;Yevgeni&quot; is weird.  Cheering against him and for Jonathan Quick is both weird and gross if you&#039;re a Penguins and Sharks fan. 

Figured y&#039;all may like this:  My friend is Russian, and watched with his 13-year-old Brooklyn-born daughter. She danced when USA won. &quot;Oh, go dance somewhere else,&quot; my friend told her, with real pain in his voice. &quot;If you didn&#039;t want a kid who cheers for Team USA against Russia, you shouldn&#039;t have come to America and had a kid!&quot; she retorted. He had to respect her logic.

Oh, and in your face, Putin! In your *face*!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My love of hockey started when the US and (then) USSR played each other in 1980. I remember to this day that my parents wanted to go grocery shopping, but I would NOT go. It was the first time as a kid that I stayed home by myself. I remember those guys...from Jack O&#039;Callahan to Buzz Schneider. Of course there is the whole Al Michaels &quot;Do you believe in miracles? Yes!!&quot; It was then that I fell for hockey.

Olympic hockey is great. The Olympics are great. Hockey is great. Cheering for your home nation is soul stirring at times. There&#039;s nothing like seeing someone from your country on that top pedestal. I truly hope the US wins this year. We haven&#039;t won since 1980 and really who doesn&#039;t want to see how Patrick Kane would celebrate a gold medal???]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve already made plans for tomorrow morning with my friends. We&#039;re all vegetarians, so I said I&#039;ll bring the facon (fake bacon), and saus&#039;ge (fake sausage), if they make the eggs and pancakes. But, I&#039;ll be in pjs and glasses. Ain&#039;t nobody got time to change into regular clothes and contacts. The things hockey fans do for the love of the sport. Losing valuable sleeping to cheer on the mother country! Let&#039;s hope Oshie can bring beast mode when we play against Canada :) (I&#039;m not bitter or anything!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awesome post!  Love the Olympics and I can&#039;t get enough of women&#039;s or men&#039;s hockey.  Bring it!  I was up at 4:00 pacific time and was able to watch the whole game before rushing my son off to his second hockey practice in less than 10 hours (yeah, we were 15 minutes late but we had a good excuse!).  

Loved the tension of the Russia/USA game.  Putin&#039;s in the stands and the pressure was on for the home team.  Captain Datysuk delivered despite just coming off an injury (please don&#039;t leave for the KHL!).  Loved Coach Danny Bylsma believing in TJ Oshie to win it in front of a passionate Russian crowd rooting for their home team.  

What a game!  Couldn&#039;t have asked for a better Saturday morning.  Proud of the Russian players and proud of our red/white/blue boys.  Great hockey.  Great Olympics.  More to come!!!]]></description>
