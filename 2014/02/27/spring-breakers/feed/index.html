		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m just imagining the people who arrived to their Cabo vacation and found the place crawling with hockey players.  Those lucky, lucky, lucky people.

Also, I would just like to say: I bought a pair of mirror lens wayfarers when I went to Florida last year. James Neal and I are clearly soulmates.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Those things are adorable, but when they want to play and start swinging those paws around...oh there&#039;s a lion cub too....

And DZ&#039;s shorts should be commended,  They&#039;re doing serious work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Re: #TeamHallsy&#039;s head, I&#039;m going to venture he missed a spot with the sunscreen because it was still there in the Oilers season ticket holders day pictures. I feel his pain.

Also, Amanda is not responding to my texts so I can only assume she saw this post and has been committed to some sort of facility.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1.  &quot;Puppy Bowl&quot; - There is so much perfection in that caption that I can&#039;t stand it.

2.  Del Zotto&#039;s shorts in that lion cub pic are SO NOT OK.  The tank top is bad, but those shorts should be a felony.

3.  The WUYS convention should&#039;ve been in Cabo over the Olympic break, no?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As I sit here at work while our server is completely offline and I can&#039;t do anything except use the internet....  I stumble upon my email and find this gem. Since when are Nealer and Bur friends?! MDZ and TSegs playing with lions?  All my favorites (minus Torres) in one place?!?! WHY WASN&#039;T I INVITED?! 

I work for a nonprofit and our busiest time of the year is during the holiday season - in fact, I realistically am not allowed to take a vacation unless it&#039;s between May and August because of how busy my department is.... But hot damn, if I had known this would have been waiting for me in Cabo.... I would have quit two weeks ago! (just kidding - I actually love my job and don&#039;t want to leave). But in all seriousness - This email made my day. I actually squealed when reading this - so loudly in fact that my coworkers thought I was excited that our server came back on (psyche! It didn&#039;t). Don&#039;t mind me no work will actually get done today as I&#039;ll be re-reading this post over and over again!]]></description>
