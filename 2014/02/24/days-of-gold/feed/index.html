		<description><![CDATA[Let&#039;s be friends.  Because this exactly how I feel.  I&#039;m so sad about the women.  Glen Healy called Patrick Kane selfish and I threw things at the TV.  Patrick Kane cried.  I&#039;m going to guess that Geno is hiding somewhere, more broken than any of the rest of us.  Paul Martin finally got to play for his country and now is broken.  My heart is broken.

In the meantime, I&#039;m going to watch a lot of college basketball, and hope that I&#039;m ready for hockey again on Thursday.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I feel the same way. I&#039;ve been super-cranky and itching for NHL to start back up so I can go back to cheering for my Bolts, regardless of where they&#039;re from. Happy for some of the Canada team and still hate some of them lol. So excited for Marty!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Poor Scott Salmond looks like he&#039;s wearing clown pants! And of course, Crosby found his pockets right away. I&#039;ll bet those pants got stretched beyond all recognition.

I had no idea there was such bromance between Subban and Tavares. I was touched when Subban helped Tavares to the ice. I really wish Team USA could&#039;ve gotten it done, of course, but I&#039;m not upset that these guys did it.

I said it on Sunday, but Canada&#039;s win over Sweden shows that adorkable always beats the hell out of handsome. Also, like others, I&#039;m so happy to have our NHL teams back together, and not to have to cheer against players I like anymore!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was already a ball of emotion and then that post-game interview with Sid happened and I never recovered.  These last four years have been so scary, and he made it through.  SOB.

It was also great to see two wonderfully derpy, socially awkward humans (Tazer and Sid) being so darn personable and cute. I mean, Sid was actually willingly touching people!  And Toews was smiling adorably during the closing ceremony festivities!  

That being said, I&#039;m so sad that the USA men didn&#039;t medal (and that the women couldn&#039;t get gold.)  And my god, Sad Kaner is seriously going to be the death of me.  I&#039;m not a Kane/Toews shipper by any stretch of the imagination but seeing Toews hugging it out with Kane after the US/Canada game made me feel all the feels.  Poor Kaner.]]></description>

- Mike Babcock: recording the Closing Ceremonies on his camera phone like a dad, taking a selfie like a gem, sassing the press like a boss (&quot;Does anyone know who won the gold medal? See ya guys.&quot;)
- Matt Duchene singing O Canada at the top of his lungs when his teammates are all mumbling along - he doesn&#039;t care, he&#039;s an OLYMPIC CHAMPION
- PK Subban winning the Internet - &quot;SUP&quot;: http://instagram.com/p/kwz2QuBmlt/

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been really bitter for the past few days - with the women losing their 2-0 lead, and eventually losing to Canada, and the Men&#039;s not even placing, at all - I just feel like my heart has been ripped out my chest and stomped on. I feel like everyone whom I convinced to watch hockey because it&#039;s awesome - thinks I lied.  I just want the NHL back so I can start loving my favorite&#039;s again - even if they are Canadian, and I screamed, &quot;ugh i&#039;m so mad at youuuuuuuuuuuuuu,&quot; at the tv several times...  (picture me saying this in the sid voice during the all star commercial a few years ago where he gets mad at the obscene amounts of room service and says, &quot;ovechkin,&quot; and shakes his fist!). That&#039;s how I&#039;ve felt these past few days.. :( It will be better soon - my Bruins will all be in tact, no more seeing sad face Kaner, or dejected Parise - and I won&#039;t have to look at Kessel. :)]]></description>
