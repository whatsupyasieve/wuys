		<description><![CDATA[I would shush my boyfriend if he was talking during the commercial and I would sigh every time Captain Zach&#039;s face would appear... My boyfriend was like, pftt it&#039;s just Zach Parise. I&#039;m like you shut your mouth right now. That&#039;s perfect Zach - lunging for 5 minutes straight looking beautiful as ever, and being perfect. Ugh. I love him so much it hurts! Then my boyfriend would look at me as if I&#039;m crazy, and was like you love him more than me? Well - I thought that was obvious :) (haha - just kidding... sort of..).]]></description>
