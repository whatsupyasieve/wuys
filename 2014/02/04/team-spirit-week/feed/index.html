		<description><![CDATA[Why does my aquatic therapy class not have anyone as adorable as Hertl the Turtle in it?  Instead, I get hit on by 80 year old men.  Life is so unfair.

With T Pyatt and MDZ gone, and the addition of Carcillo, the Rangers hotness quotient went down a few dozen notches...not even Hank and the white gloves he wears inside his glove and blocker can atone for those losses.

Lastly, I want to party with the Caps dads.  I may not speak more than 2 words of Russian, but Ovi&#039;s dad seems like a hoot, and I guarantee the vodka isn&#039;t half as terrible as the cheap stuff I poured down my throat in college.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Okay, absolutely craaaazy conspiracy theory that I&#039;m absolutely embarrassed to admit: I think Sid&#039;s aw-shucksing his way through the interview because of Katie O&#039;Malley of PensTV (who asked the question that made him start beaming.) She interviewed him for Skates and Plates many years ago, back when Billy Guerin was still playing, and Sid was being charming and, dare I say it, flirty with her (or as charming and flirtatious as our awkward Sid is capable of being.)  Since then, I&#039;ve crazily felt like he thought she was kind of the bees knees.

Like I said, crazy.  Now I will sit in the corner and think about the ridiculousness I&#039;ve just put on the internet.]]></description>
