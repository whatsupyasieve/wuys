		<description><![CDATA[I hope I am not too late on chiming in this conversation, or this site :) My home team is Sweden but I just couldn&#039;t stay mad at Canada when Sharpie and Bergy are on the team! And then there&#039;s Hamhuis, who is absolutely adorable in a full on Winnie the Pooh costume! And now thanks to your latest post I too am a Jamie Benn fan!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The goalie fight really comes down to Miller vs. Price... tie game.
The D battle is tight, but personal preference gives iCarly lots of extra points, so USA wins.
The forwards... I mean come on. Patches, Oshie, Kessler, Wheeler, Backes, Kane, Parise... &#039;Merica.

USA all the way, every day. I will fight my Canadian relatives to the death on matters of hotness and hockey prowess. GO USA!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love how you referred to Blake Wheeler as having &quot;skill&quot; in that round. Deb and I often use &quot;talent&quot; when referring to players of an elevated score in the looks category when in public . This confuses many a man around us when said players trip over their own feet and board themselves promptly.  I don&#039;t know about today. My hopes for this Olympics were that the US medals and Canada doesn&#039;t win gold. That simple. It&#039;s scary to think the fate of the US hockey team could greatly be in the hands of the saddest panda to ever live. Kudos for finding a picture of Phil that almost looks human!]]></description>
