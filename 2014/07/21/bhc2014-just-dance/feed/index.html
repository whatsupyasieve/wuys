		<description><![CDATA[Holy crap. 

1.  How do I get Steven Stamkos to come to my wedding?  I will get engaged right damn now.  To anyone.  Surely there is one single guy in my office of 400 people.

2.  That gif of Richie is making it hurt a tiny bit less that he&#039;s no longer in blue.  Thank you.

3.  That final gif of JT &#038; PK is the most hilarious/adorable thing I&#039;ve ever seen.  Just when you think those two can&#039;t get more nauseatingly endearing, something like this surfaces.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes!  A walk-off!  I want costumes, I want a light show, I want back up dancers. Can we get the Kane sisters to contribute to the cause?  

I&#039;m not really a Kane girl, but I&#039;m with you.  I mean, his confident, smiley, measured walk over to Toews before the shuffle?  That just about killed me.  The polo is just a bonus.]]></description>
