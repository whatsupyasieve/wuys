		<description><![CDATA[No one is sure whether they&#039;re still on or off. Sid is notoriously private about his life (Thank God SOMEONE in the spotlight is - we really DON&#039;T need to know everything!) despite always being willing to talk to fans &#038; take pictures with them (&#038; their babies!!) There was a blonde model named Kathy who was spotted sitting with his family at the Olympics &#038; at one of the games at MSG in the playoffs, but there hasn&#039;t been anything else since. My feeling is that Sid wouldn&#039;t take ANY woman but Taylor (his sister) or his mom, Trina, to the NHL Awards until they were married. He&#039;s just THAT shy, awkward, &#038; private about his life. I could be wrong, but that&#039;s just the way I read him.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Whaa??  Sidney Crosby has a girlfriend??  When?  Where? Who?  Didn&#039;t he take his sister to the NHL Awards last month?  Wouldn&#039;t a girlfriend be more approps to take than a sister (especially if you&#039;re 26 years old)?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So does this negate Rob Rossi&#039;s not-what-he-would-call-girlfriend-issues theory?  Be well, Sid!  

The picture of Sid and the baby is, for some ridiculous reason, the funniest thing in the world to me.  I just love the thought process:  see Sidney Crosby at Home Depot, talk to him, get a picture with him... and your baby.  That t-shirt does fit him ever-so-nicely though.]]></description>
