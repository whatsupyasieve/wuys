		<description><![CDATA[You should add Nashville to your list of teams to love. Mostly because they&#039;re awesome and because they have a lot of good looking men on the team. Spaling and Hornqvist were two that will definitely be missed and dropping DZ lowers the hotness level for sure but Neal will help to balance it out. Will send pics when we go to games in the fall]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ugh, I&#039;m feeling awful about this.  By the end of the off-season, I just thinking &quot;James Neal, I love you but I don&#039;t like you.&quot;  On one hand, I sort of understand why they traded him, and I think (or rather, I hope) this could be a good thing for him.  On the other, WHYYYYY?

And then you throw Jussi, Tanner, Nisky, Brooks (and Cardboard Orpik!) onto the pile of misery and I just can&#039;t cope.  This is the worst time of the year.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In an attempt to cheer up a friend who was understandably upset after Friday&#039;s Neal trade I did a Google image search for Sidney Crosby and it automatically suggested adding &#039;butt&#039; &#038; &#039;shirtless&#039; to the search. Well played, Google. Well played.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Pants. You and this blog are some of the few reasons I&#039;d come out of the cave where I&#039;ve secluded my devastated self since Friday night. Please, any James Neal fans in Nashville. Feed us. We&#039;re going to be desperate here. Soon.

PS -- Is your husband gloating? Mine is. I hope yours is wiser. Or at least nicer.]]></description>
