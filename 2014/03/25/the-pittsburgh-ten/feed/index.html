		<description><![CDATA[WOW!  What a great weekend!  I&#039;m taking my son to Pittsburgh this weekend for the Blackhawks game.  Somehow I don&#039;t think I will have the same experience that y&#039;all did unless the players hang out at like McDonalds! (son is 11).  I can only imagine what would have happened if Nealer had walked in holding a puppy and wearing his glasses!  Sigh!]]></description>
