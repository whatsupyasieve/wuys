		<description><![CDATA[I was once really rude to Mark Stuart in real life as he was being a bit of a rude ass. This was shortly after I tried to wish Zdeno Chara a happy birthday (Slovak fail) and had my picture taken with Bergy. I&#039;m sure I don&#039;t have to go back into what a car crash of fangirldom THAT was ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bogosian is perfection: &quot;No, Jacob, that would be creepy.&quot;

I cannot stop giggling at the fact that Mark Scheifele has the musical taste of a 12 year old girl.  This is right up there with finding out that Carl Hagelin&#039;s go-to karaoke material is the Backstreet Boys.  Tell me you wouldn&#039;t shell out cash to see him belt out &quot;I Want It That Way.&quot;]]></description>

Not captured in screencaps but Pavelec shyly being enthusiastic about Springsteen might actually be my favorite part :3333333333333]]></description>
