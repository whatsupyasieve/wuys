		<description><![CDATA[I need as many healthy Pens back for Saturday as possible with this patchwork lineup!
Good vibes to all the boys, hope they bring it on Saturday.
My niece is so excited for her first game she even made up her own song (to the tune of &quot;Where is Thumpkin?!&quot;) I hope they are all back and put on a good show!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OK, fair enough, but honestly, I&#039;m not crying for Pittsburgh.  Aside from my own team&#039;s concerns, I have much more compassion for the line combo woes in Ottawa, Detroit, Vancouver, &#039;Peg, etc.  I&#039;m always sorry for injuries to any player, but when you&#039;re at the top of the league in nearly every category, it&#039;s hard for me to bemoan the fact that Sid hasn&#039;t been able to skate with his BFF in a while.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is not an unreasonable question at all.  It&#039;s been a BFD since Crosby came into the League.  The Pens have searched so hard for &quot;a winger for Crosby&quot; you&#039;d think they were looking for the Holy Grail.  Yes, he&#039;s the best player on the planet.  But he&#039;s at his best when his passing is as dangerous (or more) as his scoring.  To have that, he needs a guy or two up front who can finish.  Kunitz is not a 31-goal scorer alongside any other player in the game.  And Crosby&#039;s solo goal-scoring ability diminishes when it&#039;s obvious he&#039;s the only guy who&#039;s going to do it 99% (87%?) of the time.  If teams only have to defend one guy, even if that guy is Crosby, their effectiveness skyrockets.  It&#039;s why Crosby and Malkin worked well together, but that&#039;s almost too top-heavy.  Solid wingers beside each of them double the offensive threat.  The trick is consistency, which injuries have prevented.  The Pens (and their fans) are just chasing the dream - what Sid could do in a full, healthy season with the same strong winger(s) on his line... ah, the sparkly possibilities.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is probably not going to win me any points around here, but I&#039;m legitimately curious: Why is &quot;who will Crosby play with?&quot; such a BFD?  Isn&#039;t he the best player on the planet?  I&#039;m not disputing the power of chemistry, but the Penguins are a lock for the playoffs, Canada won the gold medal and Crosby is near the top of the league in points &#038; assists and is #5 in goals.  What more does this guy need?]]></description>
