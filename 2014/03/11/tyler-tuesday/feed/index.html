		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve said it before and I&#039;m saying it again: Seguinista tshirts: now with the WUYS web address underneath. Been saying it for two years.  Get on it!

And I&#039;m requesting this week&#039;s foxy Friday goes out to:
Rich Peverley (for wanting to get back on the ice as soon as he regained consciousness... AFTER being defibrillated!)
The team: for collectively leaping onto the ice to get out of the way of the medics,props to Chuck&#039;s man Seguin.
The medical support staff of the Stars and Blue Jackets - for responding as quickly as they did. If ever a timely reminder for early defibrillation saving lives was needed... 
And every single  member of off duty healthcare personnel in the stands who raced to assist.

All rock stars.  All foxy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Let me just state the obvious for myself: EVERYDAY is Tyler Day for me! :) 

Seeing him play in person a week ago, good Lord, it was embarrassing how I couldn&#039;t stop staring at him. 

And if I can&#039;t have the &quot;body-spritzer-person&quot; job, then I want the &quot;let me help you wash this off&quot; job. Where do I send in my application?]]></description>

Maybe he wouldn&#039;t be so bad to take home to mom and dad... ;)]]></description>
