		<description><![CDATA[Okay... You HAVE to make a GIF of Flower smiling/waiving/adorably shrugging after he so dangerously went halfway to the blue line to make a play during the 3rd period of the Pens/Predators game. It was for real one of the cutest things Flower (or anyone for that matter) has every done!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t handle trade deadline time. I&#039;ve already started drinking wine, and I turned off my phone because people keep texting me about Sutter&#039;s feelings. AGHGHGH what about my feelings?! Why can&#039;t it be Thursday? Or better yet, next Thursday when I leave for Philly and a whole different kind of stress to watch the Penguins play, regardless of who is on the team at that point.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The potential Brandon Sutter stuff is so stressful.  I hate it.  I&#039;m not against the idea of Ryan Kesler but I want Brandon Sutter left out of this.  (Leave Brandon alone!)  Beyond having to fathom him being traded, I  hate that they&#039;re potentially trading him while also featuring him all over the website, giving us that adorable video about his nickname, interviewing him about how excited he was about being at Soldier Field.  Stop reinforcing how great he is if you&#039;re going to trade him!  Gaaah.]]></description>
