		<description><![CDATA[You really should see Imagine Dragons live.  Not only are they a great band, but Dan, the lead singer (who is also doing the drumming), THROWS himself into both his singing and his drumming. I mean, this guy gives about 1000%.  Between that, his scruffiness and the way he fills out a deep-V t-shirt, it&#039;s really not to be missed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OK! That was WAY less embarrassing than I was expecting. I cringed WAY more during Tyler Seguin&#039;s cameos in his hetero life partner&#039;s music videos.

Also - who the EFF does Landeskög think he is being all shirtless clutching white sheets?? My body was not ready. Hockey players clutching white sheets is my most favourite thing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I appreciate and respect that guy for his aggressive drumming.  That is a man committed to the cause.

And Dutchie with the lip-syncing - A+, man.  Much like his game, he is not one to half-ass it.

Landeskog - no words needed. Only inappropriate, slow motion GIFs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I still haven&#039;t made it to the end.  About the time Gabe was shirtless and wet, I bee-lined it to Tumblr to stare at the .gifs for close to an hour.  Maybe eventually, I&#039;ll make to the the end...peering at the screen through my fingers and trying to stifle my laughter.  Kudos to them, though, for having the cajones to go for it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh my gosh, yes to what you said about The Office.  I didn&#039;t make it through more than three seasons because I couldn&#039;t handle the awkwardness. I&#039;d keep pausing, squirming on the couch/leaving the room and it would take me an hour and a half to make it through one episode.  

Thus, I watched this video on mute, paused it a lot and cringed the entire way.

That being said, I agree--good for these guys for committing so completely to this.  I&#039;d love to see the behind the scenes video.  

(And I would pay good money to see an ode to Sid&#039;s big butt and a smile.  You&#039;re a genius.)]]></description>

Every team should do this.  I have a number of ideas for the Rangers - both of the SFW and NSFW type.]]></description>
