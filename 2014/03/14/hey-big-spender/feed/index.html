		<description><![CDATA[So You will be at the game against Tampa? I am taking my niece for her 4th birthday present(all the way from NJ) and her FIRST game. She has been begging me to take her for 2 years, and has been watching the Pens since she was 6 months old. 
Hopefully Neal will be healthy and ready to go! (first time commenting, been reading for a long while)
 If you see an adorable little girl in a Crosby sweater and a crown, tell her happy birthday.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apparently, Sutter was the hero last night--he introduced Sid to the little girl, who has cystic fibrosis and was the key note speaker.

My hope is that James picked up a one day stomach flu bug and is now totally fine thanks in part to the saltines, soup and ginger ale that Paulie dropped off on his way home from Skates and Plates.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Someone walked into my office and asked me a question as I was reading this. Specifically, when I got to the part of Sid in a tux with cheekbones and children. And I lost all ability for brain function. 

James, take this as your warning: You&#039;ve got ONE WEEK. I&#039;m not coming over three thousand kilometres to miss seeing that face/beard/hair ALL OF YOU, mmmmkay?]]></description>
