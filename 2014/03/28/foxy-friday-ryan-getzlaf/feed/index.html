		<description><![CDATA[As a Duck fan, I wasn&#039;t so sure about Getzy being named the captain at first; but he&#039;s really done a great job. 

And I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve all seen this; but he and Corey are super funny with Cabbie in this clip too.. and it has Sid. :D http://youtu.be/-lSZ_sbFCZI]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Being from the east, I never cared for the Ducks or any of their players that much until I watched NHL Revealed and Cabbie and got to see Ryan Getzlaf.  He is so funny and easygoing.  He won me over with sassing Shea Weber and kidding around with Sid.  He&#039;s OK in my books.  Good choice!]]></description>
