		<description><![CDATA[We can always count on Geno for some good holiday-themed laughs. However, in all the time he was here, I never saw a Halloween pic of Neal. I&#039;ve always hoped he was Robin the year Geno was Batman. Sigh. So, ok, Preds, get in the game. Help us out!

PS -- the KISS ensemble really rocks. No pun intended. That&#039;s a good one even in this high-performance arena!]]></description>
