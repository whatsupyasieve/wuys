		<description><![CDATA[I laughed my head off at the inclusion of Kaner&#039;s iconic mouth guard in his locker room.  He&#039;s not even using it anymore, is he?  And when he was using it, he was mostly just chewing on it.  That being said, the Kaner Shuffle was a delight.  He is a delight, and yes, it makes me incredibly happy to see him (and hockey!) getting more national attention.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If there&#039;s one NHL-er who I&#039;d believe dabbles in McDonald&#039;s, it&#039;s Patrick Kane. Love you, Kaner!

As probably one of only 3 people who like the NHL AND the NBA, I was pretty thrilled to see Kaner in something this high profile and with LeBron. Pretty great for hockey.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, can we take a brief moment to talk about my fellow UW Badger, JJ Watt?  I believe he has the soul of a hockey player in a football player&#039;s body.  Like Tracy said, hard-working and humble.  He also chirped Ray Rice beautifully a few years ago: http://youtu.be/CsVBlwMQc-c]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[FYI, if you&#039;re interested: The football guy is JJ Watt. He is a defensive end for the Houston Texans. He&#039;s a beast, probably the best defensive player in the NFL. He&#039;s known for being boring like literally having no social life and constantly working out. &quot;I can have a social life when I retire.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;That football guy I don’t know, but he’s in a lot of commercials so he’s probably a Kardashian?!&quot; perfectly sums up my knowledge of, and interest in, both of those things.

Related, and unfair, I don&#039;t think you can win hockey ANYTHING in Canadian McDonalds Monopoly. But for $2 you can win Taylor Hall: https://www.netraffle.org/raffle/index.php?rid=718

Signs I&#039;m a grown up - I&#039;m not entering because there&#039;s no way I can get half of Friday off on short notice. The real kicker is that I was just IN Edmonton AT THAT EXACT RESTAURANT. I had asked my cousin that we go out somewhere I might see Oilers...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We&#039;re laughing at the idea that Kane (and Alex Morgan, and Jamie McMurray) might regularly eat McDonald&#039;s. McMurray, the NASCAR driver, has said in the past that he tries to eat clean. He&#039;s declined to mention that kind of thing since he got the McDonald&#039;s sponsorship. 

That said, it&#039;s wonderful that Kane, and American hockey in general, is getting that kind of exposure. The more hockey players in commercials, the more better!  Kane has a star quality about him.]]></description>
