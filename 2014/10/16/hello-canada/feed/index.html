		<description><![CDATA[For those wondering who made the list, the 10 are (they&#039;re not ranked) Lupul, Seguin, Crosby, Upshall, Toews, Subban, Neal, Stoll, Tavares and Gudbranson.  I would have swapped one of them out for Jamie Benn, but I can&#039;t complain too much about this list...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have NextIssue at home on my iPad, so I&#039;ll share the list tonight - but for now, another Hello! Canada issue shares 10 things I &quot;need&quot; to know about Sidney Crosby, the magazine&#039;s 2013 Most Beautiful Star (truth, and deserved) - that he grew up in New Brunswick. Wait, what?? Do they need you to take over as resident Crosby expert, Pants??]]></description>

Loved seeing her in the head-to-toe Team Canada gear in Sochi, though I always find it hilarious when hockey wives/girlfriends have to deck themselves out in gear of a country that isn&#039;t their own.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[BUYING. THIS. ISSUE. ASAP.

God, I love Canada.

This list better have Crosby and Toews at the very top, or else all credibility (of Hello Canada, heh) will be lost.  And yes, Jamie Benn and Tyler Seguin better be on that list.

In other news (aka hot but non-bachelor NHL players)... can I continue petitioning for Jonathan Bernier to be in a future Foxy Friday?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the shout out!  From what I saw on the news this morning (that&#039;s right the local news had this story - in the entertainment segment, but still) besides Sid and P.K. the other guys who made the list was Tyler Seguin, Jonathan Toews, James Neal, Joffrey Lupul and maybe John Tavares.  I&#039;m not sure cuz the images went by so fast!  Nice pics too!  Like glamour shots of Lupul.  Will pick up the issue sometime this weekend!]]></description>

1.) Viktor Stalberg
2.) Tyler Seguin
3.) Roman Josi
4.) Johnny Oduya
5.) Andy Miele

But mostly Stalberg. Because Sweden.]]></description>
