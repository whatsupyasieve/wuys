YES!!! He probably would have studied for it if at all possible. Heck, he might have tried.

Ugh and he slightly mispronounces words SO MUCH when he&#039;s nervous. My heart. &#060;333333333 Every bit of public speaking he does is, at its essence, a 7th grade book report presentation.]]></description>
