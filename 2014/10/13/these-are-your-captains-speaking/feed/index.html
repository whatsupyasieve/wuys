He is so dry, and it&#039;s hilarious.  You know he&#039;s been working on that idea for a while.  And doing a little celebratory Tazer fist pump.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;This is why you need me to control what you say.&quot; - overheard daily in my PR life, evidenced always by Crosby. Then I see Toews being all fun and I say throw that script out the window. 

I&#039;m also happy to see that the Captains have been reading the WUYS Glossary of Terms - specifically Boyfriend Shirt. Holler!]]></description>
