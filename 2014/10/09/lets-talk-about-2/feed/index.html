		<description><![CDATA[LOL! When George started to ask about supersititons I had to chuckle when Crosby said nothing. hahaha.  Was expecting him to say &quot;100 percent!&quot;  So what he didn&#039;t wear a suit? I still think he looked good.  Is it a fashion faux pas to wear blue with black?  I didn&#039;t know this.  How about the part when he adjusted his rear in the chair.  The chair can&#039;t handle his ass.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The You Can Play discussion made me tear up.  You&#039;re right--their answers were confident but not overthought and PR speak-y, and you can tell that they&#039;ve all thought about this and are ready.  What a comfort.  Makes me proud to be a fan.
