		<description><![CDATA[That picture of him with the cowboy hat...wow. Makes me want to post a comment about how I&#039;d like his D deep in my zone. 
But I won&#039;t do it, because he was a perfect gentleman when I ran into him at a bar, despite my awkward fangirlishness. He deserves better. 

I would, however, like to request a &quot;Sexy Saturday&quot; article and photocollection of Viktor Stalberg...please and thank you :)]]></description>
