		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, he did and the Twitterverse was CRAZY after it happened Saturday night! Poor Suttsy! Of course the menfolk of the Twittah (at least on my TL and many of whom are Pens fans), who would be thrilled if it were Amanda Kessel caught nude, were not happy. Us females, however, were mostly ok with it. Hahaha]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazing post!  Made my day :)

I think I may have a handle on the whole awkward Crosby pockets thing.  It may be nothing but at the same time if he poses with his hands in his pockets, nobody can have evidence of inappropriate touching (especially with kids).  Maybe I&#039;m overthinking or reaching.
 Maybe his hands are just cold :p]]></description>
