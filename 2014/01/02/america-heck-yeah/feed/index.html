		<description><![CDATA[I, too, love Team Canada (as much or slightly more than the USA)....though that may be because I haven&#039;t yet been disappointed by roster snubs.  We&#039;ll see how that balances out on the 7th.

While I am very happy with some of the decisions made for team USA, I cannot get past the whole Bobby Ryan thing.  Behind Kessel, he has the most points for an American.  It&#039;s just absurd.  

It still baffles me how Amanda Kessel is related to Phil and Blake (who could almost be twins....shudder).  She won the gene pool lotto there!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pants, I am appalled.  I am not a flag-waver or someone who chants &quot;USA! USA!&quot; but I am Team USA hockey all the way.  I&#039;m sick of Canada&#039;s winning and I love the grit and heart of the US team, although I&#039;m super pissed about some of the omissions - Ryan &#038; Yandle especially, but also Saad, Galchenyuk, Bishop and maybe even Kreider.

Yes, some of my favorite players play for other countries and I unabashedly love &quot;Oh Canada&quot; and always sing along, but this is one instance where my heart bleeds red, white &#038; blue.  McDonagh &#038; Stepan are so patriotic they don&#039;t even skate away after the anthems until the flags have left the ice - how can you not love that?  And David Backes FLIES PLANES TO SAVE ABUSED PUPPIES.  How can you not want a man like that to win a gold medal?

I&#039;m with you on Kessel maybe not being the right person to be the face of Team USA, but if you need a cheerleader to pump up the crowd for our boys, I will raise my hand with red, white &#038; blue painted nails.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When you&#039;re ready for the Phil Kessel talk, you know where to find me. I&#039;ll tell you everything you need to know.

I&#039;ll even start with leaving this adorable video of Phil and Dion chirping each other over musical preferences and cookies here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orZwIDDKvlQ]]></description>

I was secretly hoping that Torey Krug would make the team, but I knew it was a long shot.  See ya in 2018, buddy.]]></description>
