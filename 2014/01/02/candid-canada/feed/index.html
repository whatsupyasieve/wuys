		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for posting this. I just watched the video and found it to be very informative. Hard decisions to make for any country but I think even more difficult for a country like Canada with so many players to choose from. I will still be cheering on USA and must congratulate John Carlson for making the team.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know we can&#039;t put too much stock in these editing, blurred-out spreadsheet meetings, but I really got the feeling that Kunitz and Benn are making Team Canada. I know people are all &quot;NO KUNITZ NO&quot; but I&#039;m more than okay with his inclusion.

My current and possibly irrational fear is that PK Subban is not going to make the team. 

I&#039;m both so excited and also afraid for January 7th&#039;s roster announcement. Canadians should probably just be given the day off to spend time alone with their thoughts and feelings before being allowed in public again.]]></description>
