		<description><![CDATA[First off, this is my first visit to this blog and I&#039;m wondering how the heck I missed it for so long. 

Now, on to my main point - THIS POST. ALL OF IT. It irritates me that it&#039;s an automatic assumption that I&#039;m into football and hockey because of the HOT GUYZ OMG. I am a Nebraska girl, so we get indoctrinated into the football thing starting approximately at birth. I wasn&#039;t as into hockey when I was younger, but that was more a factor of not having the access to it that I do now (although for whatever reason I latched onto Mario Lemieux when I was young and have loved him ever since). When I moved to Missouri for college I caught a lot of flack for my football fandom - not because of any rivalry, but because I was a woman and couldn&#039;t possibly want to watch the game for, y&#039;know, the GAME. My love of hockey fully caught on while living in Missouri as well - easy access to Blues games on TV and a best friend that was a Pens junkie made sure of that, and those are my two favorite teams to this day. Now, I may not obsess over the stats and know every single intricacy of [insert formation name here], but that doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m not a knowledgeable fan.  Just recently, I was at a bar with friends while watching playoff football and Olympic hockey selections came up in conversation. Heads at nearby tables turned when the hockey conversation was dominated by me, and not the sportswriter at the table. Also, not every player I follow is a Hottie McHotterson. When I tell people that one of the reasons I keep an eye on the Dallas Stars is Dan Ellis, I get blank stares and confused looks (college hockey didn&#039;t come to my hometown until after I&#039;d left for college, and Ellis is the first product of that program to have regular starting time in the NHL - hometown pride!).

As a side note, one of the things that I&#039;m liking about this site so far is that you have an appreciation for, um, the aesthetics of hockey players, while still obviously being fans of the game in general. It&#039;s like you guys get me without ever having met me. Y&#039;all rock, and keep up the great work. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The double standard with this slays me. Take a look at the comments on the photo of Hilary Knight that was recently posted on the US Olympic Team&#039;s facebook page. Most of them are dudes referencing her looks, &quot;she&#039;s hot&quot;, etc. Secondly, go look at the same photo (it&#039;s her first major sports card apparently) posted on her facebook page, https://www.facebook.com/hilaryknightfanpage, where some guy decides to comment asking her to please sit on his face.

		<description><![CDATA[Personally, adorkably attractive athletes in post game giddiness is absolutely 100% how I got sucked into hockey. But it&#039;s 0% of the reason I stayed interested in it and definitely not why I pay for game center, go to games, or watch it on the big screen with friends in bars. The sport itself - the skating and pace and sheer unpredictability - is what makes it enjoyable. And really, Joffrey Lupul? Of all people to insinuate I watch hockey for and this rag picks Joffrey Lupul? I&#039;m insulted.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I 110% (sports reference!)agree with everything written here, and I also want to point out that I am appalled that article was written by a woman. Are we to assume that the only reason she became a sports writer was so she could interview all of the &quot;hot men&quot;? Does she pick who she writes about based solely on the way he looks while he is not doing what she is supposed to be writing about?
P.S. I really enjoy this blog, even if my co-workers give me strange looks for laughing out loud while we eat lunch.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amen to all of this. In addition to making people defend the popularity of beach volleyball, I always want to know how the people making these sorts of arguments justify ice girls. While I think clearing the ice is useful, I&#039;m pretty sure thise women could do the same job without that much cleavage hanging out. I think it&#039;s interesting that no one ever comments on the fact that it&#039;s a worthwhile business venture to pay these women so there&#039;s someone for men to ogle at gamrs, but many are willing to judge female fans.]]></description>

Those who know me well know I&#039;m a total hockey bore. And if the assistant head coach of my favourite team says I know my shit about hockey, then stfu about female fans... Ooh Sid Crosby&#039;s legs... Shiny.

I think you catch my drift. I&#039;m a woman. I have eyes. And I like sports. Done.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Haha I have even had people say to me things as ridiculous as, &#039;but you don even know how to skate so how can you like hockey?&#039; No joke. Apparently I can only be a hockey fan if I play hockey or know how to skate. I also like music a lot, but I&#039;m not in a band so technically I shouldn&#039;t like music either. I also really like cats but believe it or not I am not a cat (I know, right?! Shocker!) so should I not own one? That was taken way out of context but that&#039;s how insanely stupid I feel that someone saying that because I can&#039;t skate I therefore shouldn&#039;t like hockey is.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have grown up loving sports, especially football and hockey.  People in my family always joke if they have a hockey question, they should ask me.  And the questions don&#039;t revolve around who the best looking player is on a team.  My father has always been especially proud of the fact that when I read the morning paper, the first section I go for is the Sports section.  So, I, too get frustrated with people who make those same assumptions about me when I watch a sporting event.  It gets aggravating when I have to &quot;defend&quot; myself and other girls who love the game yet can appreciate the physical beauty as well.   I am glad I am not alone and we ladies should be proud of it.  I wish other people could appreciate it too....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Right on!  Unfortunately in our current society, the vast assumption is that if you have boobs, you canâ€™t possibly understand sports; especially a â€˜manlyâ€™ game like hockey.  People canâ€™t process the fact that you might actually understand the rules, and watch for the excitement of watching elite athletes sprint  around the ice while passing the puck and taking hits, all with razor blades attached to their feet.  I canâ€™t begin to list all the times Iâ€™ve quoted team/player statistics and have received only open-mouthed, shocked looks in response.  Of course I think hockey players are hot.  I also think Ryan Reynolds and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. are hotties, too.  Doesnâ€™t mean I watch The Green Lantern every weekend, and I donâ€™t remember the last time I sat through a NASCAR race.  The idea that girls enjoy watching a game, even in person, just because the players are hot is ludicrous.  We went to a Predators game last night, and it was so cold in the arena that I couldnâ€™t feel my fingers or toes by the end of the first period.  I donâ€™t know a lot of people who would pay money to freeze half to death while watching a game they donâ€™t understand just because a couple of players (okay, a lot of the Nashville players) have pretty faces.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Right on!  Unfortunately in our current society, the vast assumption is that if you have boobs, you canâ€™t possibly understand sports; especially a â€˜manlyâ€™ game like hockey.  People canâ€™t process the fact that you might actually understand the rules, and watch for the excitement of watching elite athletes sprint  around the ice while passing the puck and taking hits, all with razor blades attached to their feet.  I canâ€™t begin to list all the times Iâ€™ve quoted team/player statistics and have received only open-mouthed, shocked looks in response.  Of course I think hockey players are hot.  I also think Ryan Reynolds and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. are hotties, too.  Doesnâ€™t mean I watch The Green Lantern every weekend, and I donâ€™t remember the last time I sat through a NASCAR race.

		<description><![CDATA[Also like you mentioned, there are a lot more sports where men are way less clothed then hockey (volleyball, soccer, tennis) and some where there clothes are so tight you can see every bulge (American football) and are about as exciting as watching paint dry. If all I I wanted to do was admire hot athletes, I would choose one of those sports. if I pay for a ticket to a hockey game to sit around and let my hormones get the best of me and fangirl the whole time, it&#039;s going to be a looooong time before I see any skin or muscle bulge. The point is, hockey is exciting and interesting. Sorry to keep replying, I am really fired up!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So I know what&#039;s going on, and B) to be able to hold my own in a hocey-related conversation so I don&#039;t sound like an idiot who just regurgitated an article I saw on twitter from an unreliable source. Long story short: I love the game, I find it exciting, and my moods are affected by how my team plays. Also, there are very hot men who play and that is just a bonus, even if I make it seem like that&#039;s the only reason. Thanks for posting this article! End rant.]]></description>
