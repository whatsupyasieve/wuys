		<description><![CDATA[I have always loved Phil Kessel for unknown reasons [hello, I live in Seattle and am an Oilers fan, Toronto is far away].  This video helped me figure it all out - he&#039;s every boy from my [very small] high school all wrapped up in one quiet and shy and grumpy exterior.

Also.  If he could mail me that gorgeous 4-poster bed it would be the best Christmas miracle ever.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Things I never noticed until my 11th viewing of this video: 

The single Christmas stocking above the fireplace (Is it Phil&#039;s? Bozie&#039;s? Stella the Dog&#039;s? I must know.) and the mysterious third person watching four TVs with them. But he isn&#039;t wearing a toque so his identity is less important.

I waited all 24/7 for the Phil and Bozie roommate segment - thank god Tyler returned from injury just before the Winter Classic so HBO could give the people what they were waiting for.

(Although the &quot;David Clarkson: Subway Rider&quot; and &quot;A Peek Inside Dion Phaneuf&#039;s Closet&quot; scenes were also great. See.. the Leafs aren&#039;t so bad, you guys!)]]></description>
