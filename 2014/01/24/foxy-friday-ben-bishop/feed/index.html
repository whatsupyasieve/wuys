		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve always referred to him as &quot;The Tree&quot; because of his height. I remember back when he was playing for the Peoria Rivermen, the former St. Louis AHL team, and when I talked to people about him, I had to start calling him this so that they would know who I was talking about. However, I do not remember thinking he was this adorable, I mean just look at that smile! What a cutie!]]></description>
