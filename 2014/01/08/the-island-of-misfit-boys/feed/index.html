		<description><![CDATA[Yo, Puck Daddy, I&#039;mma let you finish pontificating on snubs, but Chuck &#038; Pants just uploaded the GREATEST Olympic snub post OF ALL TIME.

Seriously, ladies, this might be my favorite thing on any blog ever.  How do we get this to actually happen?  I volunteer to process all of the visa applications.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Marty. Ugh. Victor. Ugh. And don&#039;t forget Bishop! There&#039;s some serious tension and many WTF&#039;s in the air here in Tampa, especially over the Marty snub, with Yzerman being our GM and all. I&#039;ve already offered to host a NOlympics party at my house with our Lightning snubees, but your party looks decent too :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That clip was hilarious!  So down for this party.  I think that we also need puppies for James Neal to awkwardly hold and cats for Bobby Ryan and Kris LeTang to cuddle.  Tyler Seguin can bring Marshall too]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have ample vacation time and I&#039;ve always wanted to party with Brent Seabrook so I&#039;m in! Is Tyler Seguin not invited to this party? Tyler Seguin IS the party. He can bring... Texas things? Or his wardrobe from the ESPN Body Issue photoshoot? 

Also Viktor Hedman not bringing any shirt is a fantastic idea but CLEARLY he should also bring the karaoke machine:
