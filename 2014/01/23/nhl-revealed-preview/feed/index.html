Could they have possibly coached the narrator on proper name pronunciation? Or just stolen Liev Schrieber&#039;s rights from HBO? 

I&#039;ve got your excuse note right here...it says &quot;Maternity Dept&quot; on the top, but that&#039;s okay, cause I&#039;m pretty sure this series has the power to impregnate.]]></description>
