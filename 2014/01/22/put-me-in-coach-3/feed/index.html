		<description><![CDATA[My absolute favorite part of that locker room scene was Duper in the background saying, &quot;Yeah, don&#039;t f--- this up for us!&quot; A little Tough Love goes a long way.

Nisky is probably my favorite D-man these days! Steph&#039;s right - he did a tremendous job mentoring the Baby Pens &#038; while he&#039;s got that soft-spoken, boy-next-door sweetness going on (See: Penguins &#038; Paws Calendar, month of May!), you know he can also throw down when he has to(See: 2013 Playoffs tilt w/Kyle Okposo)! 

I. Was. Dying when they were chirping Sid on the plane for his lack of gamer skills! I tweeted about it and made sure to note that we had Nealer in glasses for more than two seconds! I was thinking of you, Pants!! :)

Ditto Katie K - favorite episode of In The Room yet!!! Adorkable x infinity!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love that Sid still isn&#039;t good at whatever video game they all play.  Talbot saying &quot;Sid&#039;s the worst&quot; and the ensuing aftermath was one of my favorite parts of 24/7 HBO Caps vs Pens (I can still hear Liev Schreiber &quot;spirited virtual battles.&quot;)  I don&#039;t like that they&#039;re all making fun of him but I suspect his teammates must delight in the fact that he&#039;s not good at EVERYTHING.

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Nisky needing more camera time. I don&#039;t think he gets far enough credit. Not only was he a great father to the baby penguins when the top D men were out but he continues to score them goals, not to mention, he&#039;s very, VERY handsome! :D]]></description>
