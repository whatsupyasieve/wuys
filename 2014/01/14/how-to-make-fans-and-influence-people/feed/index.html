		<description><![CDATA[As a Ducks fan living in Toronto, this post has brought up so many mixed emotions. Mostly it&#039;s joy at seeing a great post about the BEST TEAM IN THE LEAGUE and a deep longing to live in SoCal so I could go watch my boys play  all the time while still walking without a jacket. Oh, and not have to pay crazy prices for tickets (cough Leafs cough). Oh and cheer with fans who are cheering for the same team as me (my parents took me for Round 1 Game 3 of last season&#039;s playoffs in Detroit since they&#039;re HUGE Wings fans. I must have been 1 of 3 Ducks fans in 20 000 @ Joe Louis Arena. And the Ducks lost. Needless to say, it was hard). Anyway, I&#039;m so glad to see that a consistently great team getting the recognition it deserves! Hope to see more Ducks posts in the future :) And thanks for making my day!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Husband and I were just talking about this the other night. I said, &quot;The Ducks make me nervous.&quot; His reply, &quot;Yeah, they&#039;re flying under the radar.&quot; I said, &quot;Yeah, I&#039;m really worried.&quot; He said, &quot;See what I did there?&quot; Yeah, I got it, hubs. Back to the Ducks - THEY MAKE ME NERVOUS. In the same conference with the Hawks? Not good. They (probably) won&#039;t go down in the first round like they did last year. History can&#039;t repeat itself twice again, can it?? If so, I won&#039;t make it through this year&#039;s playoffs in one piece.]]></description>
