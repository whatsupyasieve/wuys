		<description><![CDATA[Jess, I&#039;d test it even without a mumps screening. I mean, I can think of worse reasons to miss a couple of weeks of work than &#039;Jamie Benn gave me mumps.&#039; Especially if I could guilt them into letting Tyler&#039;s dogs keep me company while I recover.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Anaheim is a hotbed for mumps, which has a 2-3 week incubation period, eh? I&#039;M SO GLAD I WAS JUST THERE TWO WEEKS AGO AT BOTH A HOCKEY ARENA AND THEME PARK FULL OF CHILD INCUBATORS.

PS - I volunteer to test the effectiveness of the mistletoe, pending a negative mumps diagnosis for all concerned parties.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yuck all around.  And OF COURSE Beau Bennett might have the mumps.  Of course.  If there is an affliction or injury to be had, he&#039;ll get it.  Sunshine, be well!

Jason Demars was my favorite part of the Sharks Holiday Sweater video so it makes me happy to see that he&#039;s continuing the fun with Benn and Seguin.  I really hope that Jamie Benn just happened to have those red New Balances in his closet--they just make me like him more.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That holiday sweater/boxers/tights/mistletoe pic (Demers hashtagged it with #kissmemistletoe -- well, if you INSIST) is pretty much the best thing in the world right now since I saw it whilst in a taxi to take my cat to the animal hospital on my birthday. Bless you, Dallas Stars, and your social media-savvy boys who happen to be very, very, very easy on the eyes.

Although if I&#039;m nitpicking (which I&#039;m not - I swear!), Tyler&#039;s sweater isn&#039;t really Christmasy, and Jamie&#039;s seems to be more of a long-sleeved tee. Am I the only one thinking this? I am NOT hating, just, uh, noticing... after meticulous inspection.  :)]]></description>
