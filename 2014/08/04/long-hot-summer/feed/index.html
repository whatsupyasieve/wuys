		<description><![CDATA[I discovered this blog a few months ago and just wanted to say that it&#039;s everything that is right in the world.  

Also, thank you for the update on Sid.  You can never have too much Sid.  Now, does anyone know where Tazer has been this summer?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Only one more year of Tavares playing in the parking lot.  Sidney is gorgeous.  Wish he&#039;d bend down and sign something for me.  Can you ace detectives do me a solid?  I hear Adam Henrique posted a Facebook video of himself doing the ice bucket challenge today but can&#039;t find it.  Shirtless. Or.  Wet with his shirt on - That is one video I need to see.  Merci!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It was definitely not the caution tape. I assume at some point before they came out there was a threat that if one person misbehaved they would *take the hockey players away* which is a threat that will make 95% of Canadians stick to their best behaviour and police the other 5%]]></description>
