		<description><![CDATA[When I saw the screenshot on my facebook feed, I yelled &quot;OH MY GOD!&quot; and threw my phone across the couch.  I do not think I&#039;ve regained the ability to speak.  Or think, actually.  I&#039;m about to fangirl flail on tumblr about the things the hips are doing in this video.  My god, the hips.  And the thighs.

Also, thank you for writing about this in my hour of need.  I was thinking &quot;I can&#039;t process this!  Does WUYS know!?  What are they saying!?!?!?&quot; and there you were.]]></description>
