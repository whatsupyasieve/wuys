<p><strong>That&#8217;s MY name. On the FRONT ROW of the WHITE HOUSE event with the PENGUINS and the CUP and POTUS.</strong>  Yesterday was amazing!</p>
<div id="attachment_22861" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8399-1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-22861 size-large" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8399-1-500x325.jpg" alt="img_8399" width="500" height="325" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8399-1-500x325.jpg 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8399-1-300x195.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8399-1.jpg 522w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Moore Sisters (no relation) pretending we are calm.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, we got to the White House, where I apparently did not set off any security alerts. Good thing they don&#8217;t read this blog. After having our IDs checked, bags x-rayed and bodies metal detected by extremely friendly Secret Service agents, we were sniffed by a bomb dog who I didn&#8217;t even get to see! I bet he was cute. I got over that when we entered the fancy State Floor antechamber and spent 45 minutes pretending not to edge ever closer to the main door. Mario walked by. I acted cool. No sense in getting tossed out before the show.</p>
<div id="attachment_22859" style="width: 272px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8492.jpg"><img class="wp-image-22859 size-full" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8492.jpg" alt="img_8492" width="262" height="528" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8492.jpg 262w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8492-149x300.jpg 149w" sizes="(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The door to somewhere Presidential</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When doors opened, there was the Cup, shining like a diamond on the stage.  We walked past seats reserved to Members of Congress, and <strong>there was my name on practically the closest seat in the entire event to the Cup</strong>. Don&#8217;t ask how I got it &#8211; my Fairy Godsister made it happen and now I owe her. I don&#8217;t know what could repay this. Organ donation? And not an organ that humans have two of and can spare one.</p>
<div id="attachment_22847" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WH.png"><img class="wp-image-22847 size-large" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WH-500x260.png" alt="wh" width="500" height="260" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WH-500x260.png 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WH-300x156.png 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WH-768x400.png 768w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WH.png 986w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Always bring a redheaded friend so you can find yourself on TV.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We marveled at this fact for a good long while, taking pictures of/with Stan (that&#8217;s what I call him now that we&#8217;re friends who&#8217;ve spent time together.) Several active duty servicemen were on hand to ensure that <del>we</del> people didn&#8217;t <del>hug</del> touch the cup, since it was just sitting on a table like it wanted to validate your parking ticket.</p>
<div id="attachment_22858" style="width: 447px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/front-row.png"><img class="wp-image-22858 size-full" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/front-row.png" alt="front-row" width="437" height="409" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/front-row.png 437w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/front-row-300x281.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Who are these really important people in the front row?</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the band played &#8220;Fields of Gold&#8221; by Sting 26 times, the team was announced. The audience stood and they guys streamed in, dark-suited and not a one of them looking like they could punch your lights out. Every woman in the room moved her wedding ring to the opposite hand. On either side of me, friends asked, &#8220;Who&#8217;s the one with the hair?&#8221; only they meant different guys &#8211; Hagelin and Letang. No Sid yet.</p>
<p>When the applause and brief &#8220;Let&#8217;s Go Pens&#8221; chant died out, we all stood awkwardly in silence. For a long time. It was like a Catholic wedding full of non-Catholics who are unsure when it&#8217;s okay to sit back down. Then the band finished the only other song they know and the President, Bettman, Burkle, Mario and Sid were announced.</p>
<div id="attachment_22853" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8408.jpg"><img class="wp-image-22853 size-large" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8408-500x375.jpg" alt="img_8408" width="500" height="375" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8408-500x375.jpg 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8408-300x225.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8408.jpg 653w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">No zoom was used in the making of this photo.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obama went to the podium. Mario and Burkle took his left, and Bettman and Sid took the right. Right by the Cup. RIGHT BY ME. The Queen of England&#8217;s didn&#8217;t have this good a seat at Will &amp; Kate&#8217;s wedding.</p>
<div id="attachment_22854" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8490.jpg"><img class="wp-image-22854 size-large" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8490-500x375.jpg" alt="img_8490" width="500" height="375" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8490-500x375.jpg 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8490-300x225.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8490.jpg 605w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">What does he do with all these jerseys?</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obama’s speech was great. Of course he has the best speechwriters in the world, but they hit the nail on the head with the hockey jokes and Pens’ inside references, and POTUS delivered it like he spent last season watching ROOT Sports and reading WUYS. We could not have written it better ourselves! And every time he looked toward the Cup or Sid, he was looking right at us.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_22855" style="width: 464px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8489-2.jpg"><img class="wp-image-22855 size-full" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8489-2.jpg" alt="img_8489" width="454" height="525" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8489-2.jpg 454w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8489-2-259x300.jpg 259w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">POTUS making sure we behave.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the speech, the Pens did the jersey presentation, then brought the Cup back to the group for a photo. Which meant I got to see this in more scope and detail than an IMAX 3D movie:</span></p>
<div id="attachment_22851" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-22851 size-large" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1-500x241.jpg" alt="1" width="500" height="241" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1-500x241.jpg 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1-300x144.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1-768x370.jpg 768w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1.jpg 1001w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Trophy. And also the Stanley Cup.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When time machines are invented, you know where to find me.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_22857" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8470-1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-22857 size-large" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8470-1-500x469.jpg" alt="img_8470" width="500" height="469" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8470-1-500x469.jpg 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8470-1-300x281.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8470-1-768x720.jpg 768w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8470-1.jpg 863w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Obama&#8217;s first and last Stanley Cup Champs.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The President shook some politicians’ hands, waved to us as if we’d catch up at happy hour, and headed out… leaving us all standing awkwardly again, waiting for permission to leave. Or confirmation that no one would be tackled for moving. I kept my seat for fear that Secret Service had, during the event, Googled the people in the front row. The team was eventually released to exit, walking past us and the Cup one by one like the eveningwear portion of the Miss America pageant. And then, briefly before we left, it was just us at the Cup again, like old times.</span></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the full video:</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/NXZE5NfwyJE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was quite the kickoff to the 2016-2017 season. I blindly insist my team will win the Cup every season, but this year, I say it with confidence. With hope. And because I would really like to attend this event in October 2017, and watch Hilary stand in front of Letang, Crosby and Co., look right into the camera, and ask Bill if she should hire any interns.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_22856" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8433.jpg"><img class="wp-image-22856 size-large" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8433-500x384.jpg" alt="img_8433" width="500" height="384" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8433-500x384.jpg 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8433-300x230.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8433.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Make it look heavy, they&#8217;re taking photos.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: If you read this before 2:03PM, I made some edits. Remember on <em>Sex and the City</em>, when Carrie knew she really liked the guy because she couldn&#8217;t remember what he looked like? Well I was that excited.</p>

<p>So, are you guys excited? Nervous? Wondering who the hell is on your team these days? I am. And as ever, asking myself the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything:</p>

<p>USA Today <del>accurately reports</del> predicts the Penguins will win the President&#8217;s Trophy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that list holds, we&#8217;ll have to break up this lovefest in the first round. NHL 2016-17, already imaginarily testing my loyalties.</p>
<p>(Editor&#8217;s note: &#8220;Imaginarily&#8221; is not a word. Additional  note: We don&#8217;t have an Editor.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/16099945/nhl-2016-17-stanley-cup-futures-odds-westgate-las-vegas-superbook">ESPN featured Vegas odds</a> last week that had the Hawks and Bolts atop the likely Cup winners. I like this because the Rangers, Flyers, and Bruins are all missing.</p>
<div id="attachment_22844" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/odds.png"><img class="wp-image-22844 size-large" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/odds-500x314.png" alt="odds" width="500" height="314" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/odds-500x314.png 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/odds-300x189.png 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/odds.png 549w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Bolts improved considerably by doing&#8230; nothing.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, pre-season predictions are almost never right. Even those based on actual analysis of talent and roster, matchups and Corsis nearly always miss. So far, I am doing pretty well by just picking the Penguins every year.</p>
<div id="attachment_22845" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/odds2.gif"><img class="wp-image-22845 size-large" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/odds2-500x210.gif" alt="odds2" width="500" height="210" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/odds2-500x210.gif 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/odds2-300x126.gif 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Blackhawks fans just laughed.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll do that again this year: look deep into my crystal ball (pint glass) and pretend I see glorious victory for my team shining brightly above a pile of broken, trampled enemies.</p>
<p>But until then, <strong>welcome back, hockey season</strong>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The playoffs are a tough time, when I want all my favorite players to have transcendent, legendary, career-making experiences&#8230; while their teams still lose. But someone has to win every round, and so it may as well have happened like this:</p>
<p>John Tavares, middle school science teacher, registered tax lawyer and upholder of dad-styles, scores to tie the game with 53 seconds left, giving his team the chance to clinch their first playoff series victory in 23 years.</p>

<p>Then John wins the game in double OT &#8211; which is waaaaaay past his bedtime, y&#8217;all.</p>

<p>And front page news is made.</p>
<div id="attachment_22830" style="width: 466px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/isles.png"><img class="wp-image-22830 size-full" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/isles.png" alt="isles" width="456" height="491" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/isles.png 456w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/isles-279x300.png 279w" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Okay, it&#8217;s back-page news, but on a tabloid. #same</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now when we write a Disney movie based on this blog, it&#8217;ll just be clips of last night.</p>
<p>I hope John celebrated wildly after the win. That he rushed out without even ironing his shirt collar, then drank ice tea, but in a pint glass so it looked like beer.</p>
<div id="attachment_22831" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/john3.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-22831" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/john3.gif" alt="#protip" width="320" height="240" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">#protip</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As mentioned, the Isles last won a playoff series in 1993. As a Pens fan, I remember this victory &#8211; it ended Pittsburgh&#8217;s bid for a third-straight Cup. John does not remember: he was 2 years old. I consoled myself by blasting <em>The Bodyguard</em> soundtrack and singing along to Whitney Houston in the shower &#8211; because it was the #1 album, and I wasn&#8217;t old enough to drive.</p>
<div id="attachment_22833" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/andy.gif"><img class="size-large wp-image-22833" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/andy-500x200.gif" alt="Was there a vote?

I missed it.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll soon be back to work, hoping every team (that isn&#8217;t mine) loses every single game. Two losers per series, zero winners, except the Penguins. Such is my playoff bloodlust that I would bend the rules of reality to my will. But for now, I&#8217;m taking a moment to be happy for John, because you know this is his wildest, lifelong dream of an aw-shucks moment.</p>

<p>There is so much going on in that photo, I don&#8217;t even care that he&#8217;s wearing a chain like it&#8217;s Labor Day 2003 in Cape May, NJ. Once again, pockets have an existential crisis over failure to perform their basic function. If you&#8217;ve never contemplated the cosmic mystery of the Dorito ratio, allow my other favorite Captain to demonstrate&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_22822" style="width: 275px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cap2.jpg"><img class="wp-image-22822 size-medium" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cap2-265x300.jpg" alt="" width="265" height="300" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cap2-265x300.jpg 265w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cap2.jpg 378w" sizes="(max-width: 265px) 100vw, 265px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/dorito.gif">GIF: Captain America eating Doritos</a></p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I digress. Where will the Pens rank when the season ends in TWO GAMES? Who will they face in the playoffs? Will Crosby shave off what is honestly some <em>great</em> facial hair he has going on? He is grooming it now, thank heaven. From scraggle four days ago:</p>

<p>To sleek two days ago (presumably the same day as the shirt photo above):</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/alisonsykora/status/717892091376963584">@Alisonsykora</a> is worried about these important matters, and you should be too. Because I cannot have any thoughts past this.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Drum roll! The votes are in&#8230; and it was not really that close.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NHL MAN MADNESS 2016 WINNER: SIDNEY CROSBY</strong></p>

<p><strong>66% of the vote went to Sid.</strong> He wold clearly have preferred 87%, but this is a higher percentage than he got in wins over Letang, Ekblad and Price. What can I say? We Eastern Conference girls have a lot to choose from.</p>

<p>Of course, you are also fans of:</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">I mean athleticism, guys! From the greatest player in the game!</p>
<div id="attachment_22805" style="width: 278px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sid91.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-22805" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sid91.gif" alt="I went to work like this." width="268" height="299" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I went to work like this.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, you are no help. If you don&#8217;t think Crosby&#8217;s the best player in the game, well, everyone&#8217;s entitled to be wrong sometimes. (jk)</p>

<p>But I think most people can appreciate his&#8230; bonus features.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are gold medals and a Stanley Cup and trophies all over the place, not to mention the Penguins hot streak of late. Sid was NHL 1st Star for the month of March.</p>
<div id="attachment_22814" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/crosby.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-22814" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/crosby-500x431.jpg" alt="Currently 3rd in points this season" width="500" height="431" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/crosby-500x431.jpg 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/crosby-300x259.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/crosby.jpg 525w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Currently 3rd in points this season</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And his 600th career assist, notched this weekend.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You all know how I feel about Sid, and now you know how the majority of other people (who voted in this poll) feel too. I could go on for&#8230; the 5 1/2 years this blog has existed, in fact. But this is the .gif I have bookmarked in my browser, probably my favorite go-to Sid of all time.</p>
<div id="attachment_22806" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sid-kid.gif"><img class="wp-image-22806 size-full" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sid-kid.gif" alt="Right in the feels." width="500" height="287" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Right in the feels.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a Pens fan, you&#8217;re really enjoying the games right now. And maybe a little extra in-game. Let&#8217;s hope we get to enjoy that all the way till June.</p>
<div id="attachment_22809" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sid-hair.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-22809" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sid-hair.gif" alt="gif by maljic.tumblr.com" width="500" height="250" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">gif by <a href="http://maljic.tumblr.com/post/141745067409">maljic.tumblr.com</a></p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re not a Pens fan, there &#8216;s still plenty of off-ice Crosby to keep you, um, occupied.</p>
<div id="attachment_22810" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sid-beach.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-22810" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sid-beach.gif" alt="gif from puckducky.tumblr.com" width="500" height="256" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">gif from puckducky.tumblr.com</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So congratulations to Sidney Crosby, NHL Man Madness 2016 Winner. The competition where we all win.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over 1000 votes are in, and we are down to this:</p>
<div id="attachment_22784" style="width: 1130px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/braket-final.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-22784" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/braket-final.png" alt="Click for larger version" width="1120" height="519" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/braket-final.png 1120w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/braket-final-300x139.png 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/braket-final-500x232.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1120px) 100vw, 1120px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Click for larger version</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NHL Man Madness 2016 Bracket Challenge Final: <strong>Sidney Crosby v Jamie Benn</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_22785" style="width: 399px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/final4.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-22785" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/final4.jpg" alt="This is the gold standard." width="389" height="280" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/final4.jpg 389w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/final4-300x216.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This is the gold standard.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wow, that is a lot of yes. It&#8217;s the best hypothetical situation ever &#8211; so great, it can only be summed up by our spirit animal Emma Stone performing Lip Sync Battle on Jimmy Fallon:</p>
<div id="attachment_22790" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/emma.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-22790" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/emma.gif" alt="Everybody hands go up" width="500" height="280" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Everybody hands go up</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sidney Crosby cleared Carey Price handily, with nearly 70% of the vote. This I understand. I mean, they don&#8217;t even make pockets you can put this in.</p>
<p><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sid6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22786 size-full" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sid6.jpg" alt="You get the picture." width="580" height="412" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sid6.jpg 580w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sid6-300x213.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sid6-500x355.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jamie Benn, however, surprises me a little. I get it &#8211; I can clearly see what you&#8217;re voting for here &#8211; but I though Tyler would take this one. Instead, Jamie earned a whopping 75% of the vote. I sent Chuck to check on Tyler, just in case(s).</p>
<p><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/benn.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22787" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/benn.jpg" alt="benn" width="681" height="412" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/benn.jpg 681w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/benn-300x181.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/benn-500x302.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what&#8217;ll it be?</p>
<div id="attachment_22788" style="width: 439px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sid5.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-22788" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sid5.gif" alt="Choose..." width="429" height="241" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Choose&#8230;</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brunette? Canadian? Captain? All of the above?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s no help.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Carey Price v Sidney Crosby</strong></span></p>
<p>You <em>love</em> Carey Price. I don&#8217;t get it &#8211; or I&#8217;ve never really tried &#8211; so this one will remain a mystery to me! Stamkos fared slightly better than Bergeron, Faulk or Ericksson, which is to say that he got more than 35% of the vote. And so Price moves on confidently.</p>
<div id="attachment_22762" style="width: 255px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/price.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-22762" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/price.gif" alt="I think he can hear me blogging." width="245" height="250" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I think he can hear me blogging.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Sidney Crosby hadn&#8217;t won, I would have tampered with these election results. Trust me, I am not above a little espionage to keep things right with the world! Luckily, while twenty-nothing-year old Aaron Ekblad made a surprisingly strong show (39%!), Crosby won this fair and square.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tyler Seguin v Jamie Benn</strong></span></p>
<p>It was always coming down to this. Entire fictional/aspirational lives are built on just such a conundrum &#8211; Peeta v Gale, Edward v Jacob, Ron v Harry, and presumably a great many that exist outside young adult books, but not with this kind of angst. I mean, they&#8217;re BEST FRIENDS. They are a set. And they&#8217;re possibly more in love with each other than they could ever be with you.</p>
<div id="attachment_22772" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/seguin-benn.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-22772" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/seguin-benn.gif" alt="They can't make us choose." width="600" height="339" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">They can&#8217;t make us choose.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tyler faced a worthy opponent in Zach Parise, who got a whopping 44% of the vote. I am shocked! But only one winning smile can win the day. Jamie struggled early, but ended up beating Gabe the Babe with 64%.</p>
<p>Now, by choosing only one of Tyler or Jamie, you could choose none &#8211; because they&#8217;d likely choose each other. Or you could destroy this fanfic-worthy bromance and ruin everything. That&#8217;s right, with just one click.</p>
<div id="attachment_22773" style="width: 811px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/r2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-22773" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/r2.jpg" alt="Life is hard." width="801" height="305" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/r2.jpg 801w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/r2-300x114.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/r2-500x190.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 801px) 100vw, 801px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Life is hard.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Man, that is tough. Seguin is a human gif-machine but Benn is so adorkable. Either way, can you really lose?</p>

<p>To aid in these decisions, here&#8217;s a helpful visual guide.</p>
<p><strong>Carey Price v Steven Stamkos</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_22749" style="width: 503px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stammer.jpg"><img class="wp-image-22749 size-full" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stammer.jpg" alt="stammer" width="493" height="252" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stammer.jpg 493w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stammer-300x153.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Goalie and the Natural</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never paid <del>much</del> any attention to Carey Price, but y&#8217;all <em>love</em> him. And I use &#8220;y&#8217;all&#8221; to demonstrate the one thing I know about Carey Price &#8211; he&#8217;s a cowboy. He can do horse-related things and also survival, which according to many Twitter comments would make his useful in case of zombie apocalypse. (No one suggested he compete on &#8220;Naked and Afraid&#8221; which frankly calls into question this whole bracket challenge.)</p>
<div id="attachment_22756" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/price1.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-22756" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/price1.gif" alt="Judo chop!" width="500" height="280" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Judo chop!</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I submit to you that as living off the land and shooting-while-running are exceptional skills, Stamkos is not without off-ice talents of his own.</p>

<p>You decide what&#8217;s more likely. The Walking Dead Reality Show or a young adult fiction series-turned-Hollywood blockbuster series starring a 60-goal scorer.</p>
<p><strong>Sidney Crosby v Aaron Ekblad</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s really fair, though, right? Finding a photo of Seguin with a shirt (and pants) on is not that easy. But don&#8217;t rule Zach out &#8211; he did take down Toews, after all.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m just not sure anyone can stand up to Tyler.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gabriel Landeskog v Jamie Benn</strong></p>
<p>This bracket is the toughest for me by a mile. They&#8217;re both so&#8230; it&#8217;s impossible. Gabe refuses to wear a shirt, even while making you breakfast. Jamie can&#8217;t <em>not</em> be a dork. Not even for a second. Not even with his shirt off! It&#8217;s Kryptonite.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The NHL Man Madness 2106 Round 2 voting is done, and it has left some handsome debris in its wake.</p>
<ul>
<li>Votes: 660</li>
<li>Upsets: at least one</li>
<li>Hearts broken: Mine, twice</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_22730" style="width: 1131px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bracket-QF.png"><img class="wp-image-22730 size-full" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bracket-QF.png" alt="Bracket QF" width="1121" height="517" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bracket-QF.png 1121w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bracket-QF-300x138.png 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bracket-QF-500x231.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1121px) 100vw, 1121px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Click for larger version</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jonathan Toews lost.</strong> Not that Zach Parise isn&#8217;t just as charmingly handsome or likely to put his coat over a puddle so your shoes don&#8217;t get wet walking to his luxury car, but still. Jonathan Toews <em>lost</em>. He doesn&#8217;t&#8230; do that. Ever. Not since that ASG Skills Competition when he didn&#8217;t know the shooting round had started!</p>
<div id="attachment_22731" style="width: 581px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/t2.png"><img class="wp-image-22731 size-full" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/t2.png" alt="t2" width="571" height="322" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/t2.png 571w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/t2-300x169.png 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/t2-500x282.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">But I didn&#8217;t have time to activate Manitoba!</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zach got 53.3% of the vote. For once in hockey, the US is all&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_22732" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/parise.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-22732" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/parise.gif" alt="#sorrynotsorry" width="500" height="240" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">#sorrynotsorry</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>John Tavares also lost</strong>, to Steven Stamkos, by 93 votes. If it had been 91 votes I would have tossed myself off the Annapolis bridge. (Note: not that high). As it is, I feel like:</p>
<div id="attachment_22733" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/despicable.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-22733" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/despicable.gif" alt="I'm gonna hold my breath till I get a new one." width="500" height="280" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I&#8217;m gonna hold my breath till I get a new one.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And you know how Tavares feels? No, not sad. Well maybe a little, on the inside, but he&#8217;d never been so ungracious as to show it. He&#8217;ll just take his whatever-place-finish and shucks, thanks so much to the hundreds of people who <em>did</em> think he was handsome!</p>
<div id="attachment_22734" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/tavares1.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-22734" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/tavares1.gif" alt="He will actually wear this, and not just when you visit." width="500" height="262" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">He will actually wear this, and not just when you visit.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Stamkos says:</p>
<div id="attachment_22735" style="width: 475px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stammer2.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-22735" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stammer2.png" alt="A fave from our friend Alexis and heygirlimstevenstamkos.tumblr.com." width="465" height="377" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stammer2.png 465w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stammer2-300x243.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A fave from our friend Alexis and <a href="http://heygirlimstevenstamkos.tumblr.com/">heygirlimstevenstamkos.tumblr.com</a>.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crosby v Letang was way too close at the start. Hey, I love Disney Princes, but this is Sid we&#8217;re talking about! Luckily, Pierre Maguire was free to stuff the ballot box all day long, and <strong>Crosby took home his round with +170 votes</strong>.</p>
<div id="attachment_22736" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sid.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-22736" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sid.gif" alt="Act like it was part of the plan." width="400" height="211" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Act like it was part of the plan.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marko Dano surprisingly got 36% of the vote in his round &#8211; I still haven&#8217;t looked this guy up. If he fell out of the sky right now and landed on me, I wouldn&#8217;t know him. But you can bet <strong>Tyler Seguin didn&#8217;t even blink</strong> at this competition.</p>
<div id="attachment_22737" style="width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/seguin.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-22737" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/seguin.gif" alt="Roll my windows down and cruise." width="540" height="248" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Roll my windows down and cruise.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was surprisingly no competition between Jamie Benn and James Neal, as <strong>Benn got 75% of that vote</strong>. Is it the Nashville? The not scoring 30 goals, not getting suspended, fact that I&#8217;ve barely blogged all season? You&#8217;ve all forgotten?</p>
<div id="attachment_22738" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/neal.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-22738" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/neal.gif" alt="I didn't want to leave you." width="500" height="281" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I didn&#8217;t want to leave you.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or is the awkward panda-perfect hair-tattoo of a graveyard just too much to overcome?</p>
<div id="attachment_22739" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/benn.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-22739" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/benn.gif" alt="I dream of Jamie." width="500" height="277" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I dream of Jamie.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hahahah WHAT is that .gif? Forget it, I just changed my vote to Jamie Benn also. Sorry, Neal.</p>
<p>While the Gabe Landeskog v Roman Josi category caused some people real-life conflict&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_22740" style="width: 571px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/tweet.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-22740" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/tweet.png" alt="So, you're saying not all late-night hookups are classy?" width="561" height="76" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/tweet.png 561w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/tweet-300x41.png 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/tweet-500x68.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">So, you&#8217;re saying not all late-night hookups are classy?</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gabe to Babe lived up to his name</strong> and brought in 58% of the votes. How does he feel about fending off a handsome opponent and winning your heart?</p>
<div id="attachment_22741" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/gabe1.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-22741" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/gabe1.gif" alt="This violates campaign laws, right? It must." width="500" height="265" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This violates campaign laws, right? It must.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With 71% of the votes,<strong> Aaron Ekblad beat Tom Wilson.</strong> (At the polls, not on the ice. Please don&#8217;t fight Tom Wilson.) It was a fascinating battle until you remember 1) they&#8217;re both 12 and b) no one likes the Panthers. At least not anyone who can .gif. Someone, please, fill the void of Ekblad gifs in the world.</p>
<div id="attachment_22742" style="width: 634px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ekblad.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-22742" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ekblad.jpg" alt="Now imagine this photo could move." width="624" height="344" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ekblad.jpg 624w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ekblad-300x165.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ekblad-500x276.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Now imagine this photo could move.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly &#8211; and I saved this for a reason &#8211; <strong>Carey Price trounced Justin Faulk</strong>, winning 77% of the vote. Price beat Mike Green by exactly the same margin in Round One.</p>
<div id="attachment_22743" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/carey.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-22743" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/carey.gif" alt="Impressive, right?" width="500" height="286" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Impressive, right?</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, we&#8217;re throwing Carey a wrench. When I created this bracket challenge, I spent 0.2 seconds thinking about the Bruins, and the first Bruin that came to mind was Loui Eriksson. I can&#8217;t tell you why. But I can tell you what I missed &#8211; Patrice Bergeron. Holy Hannah, you people love Bergy. I get it&#8230; no, I don&#8217;t really. He&#8217;s still a Bruin. But democracy being what it is, I am forced to accept a write-in candidate. So&#8230;.</p>
<div id="attachment_22744" style="width: 284px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bracket-Run-Off.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-22744" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bracket-Run-Off.png" alt="This is getting very House of Cards" width="274" height="134" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This is getting very House of Cards</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Bergy had been in Eriksson&#8217;s place, he would surely have beaten Justin Faulk. Bergy certainly would have given Price a run for this money in this round. Now that we know Price is through to the Quarterfinal, here&#8217;s the wrench:</p>
<p>We&#8217;re calling a run-off. <strong>One round, only one vote: Bergeron v Price.</strong> If Price wins, he stays. If Bergy wins, he replaces Price entirely in the spot he would have rightfully won if Chuck were around to throw dishes and remind me he was missing in the first place.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://surveyplanet.com/56f5e1dd5a3845081e47f79c">VOTE HERE: The Run-Off &#8211; Bergeron v Price</a></strong></p>
<div id="attachment_22746" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/bergy.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-22746" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/bergy.jpg" alt="Okay, now I kind of get it again." width="450" height="300" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/bergy.jpg 450w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/bergy-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Okay, now I kind of get it again.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your mission now is simple. Bergeron or Price? The winner will face Steven Stamkos in the Quarterfinal Round. You&#8217;ve had it easy, Carey, but you need your game face now.</p>
<div id="attachment_22745" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/carey-2.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-22745" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/carey-2.gif" alt="I'm here, coach. I'm ready." width="400" height="224" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I&#8217;m here, coach. I&#8217;m ready.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Voting in the run-off ends Monday at 12 PM Eastern</strong>, in case you&#8217;re off social media for the weekend. Like I am always trying to be. Assuming there are people who succeed.</p>

<p>There you have it, folks. Gabe the Babe dispatched Chris Higgins&#8217; abs, taking home the trophy for biggest win with 88% of the vote. Disney Prince Kris Letang had the second highest with 84.3% over Lupul. Benn, Josi, Seguin, Crosby, Stamkos and Carey Price all topped 70% in their respective categories.</p>
<div id="attachment_22723" style="width: 255px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-22723" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/gabe.gif" alt="Ain't even sweating" width="245" height="245" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ain&#8217;t even sweating</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The closest race went to Marko Dano, who beat Joe Pavelski by three votes. THREE! Democracy, people. Other tight races were Ekblad over Lundqvist by 4% and Wilson over Gingeroux by 6%. John Tavares won by 7% &#8211; way too close for me, but I would have just lied if he&#8217;d lost. (Democracy!)</p>
<div id="attachment_22722" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-22722" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/tavares.gif" alt="He knows the people in charge." width="500" height="280" /><p class="wp-caption-text">He knows the people in charge.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most heated campaign came from <a href="https://twitter.com/eyetotelescope">@eyetotelescope</a> and #TeamToews, who locked up the Original Canadian Dream&#8217;s 8% win over Jeff Carter.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last &#8211; and only &#8211; time I gave a rat&#8217;s ass about NCAA March Madness basketball was a) when Sidney Crosby was at the next table and b) I was lying. But this important bracket challenge had me excited: <strong><a href="http://www2.tsn.ca/bardown/Story.aspx?Pretty%2bHockey%2bPlayer%2bMadness%2b2016%2bis%2bsweeping%2bthe%2bnation&amp;id=575698">BarDown: Pretty Hockey Player Madness 2016</a></strong></p>
<div id="attachment_22711" style="width: 588px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-22711 size-full" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/bardown.png" alt="bardown" width="578" height="494" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/bardown.png 578w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/bardown-300x256.png 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/bardown-500x427.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Vote in the Bardown Bracket HERE.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until I tried it. And the problems began.</p>
<ul>
<li>Josi vs Gabe the Babe in the first round?! Can I just win the loser and go home happy?</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t know 60% of the Pacific Division contenders. They play hockey past my bedtime.</li>
<li>Tyler Seguin vs. Patrick Sharp? Like, you&#8217;re teammates on the train to the Capital, but once you hit the arena, it&#8217;s every handsome man for himself? I hope they refuse at the end and hold hands.</li>
<li>Paul Martin made the bracket? Hey San Jose!</li>
<li>Sidney Crosby vs. Jared Boll. Prince Charming vs. the Wicked Queen&#8217;s eyebrows.</li>
<li>And then it was over. NO STAMKOS? NO TAVARES? What kind of rigged crap is this?</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_22712" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-22712" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/biden.gif" alt="Much love for Uncle Joe." width="500" height="281" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Much love for Uncle Joe.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I created a real, better bracket for us. With the help of everyone on Twitter during the Pens/Caps game last night, we present to you&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>WUYS NHL Man Madness 2016</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22710" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WUYSMM-Rd-1.png" alt="WUYSMM Rd 1" width="1090" height="522" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WUYSMM-Rd-1.png 1090w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WUYSMM-Rd-1-300x144.png 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WUYSMM-Rd-1-500x239.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1090px) 100vw, 1090px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s not perfect. I had to pick someone from every team, which meant only a few teams could send multiple handsome faces. Many competed, few made the bracket. I divided East vs West and used a random generator to seed the players.  The rest, as they say, is up to you.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://surveyplanet.com/56ef31b2493d480c1bf136be">VOTE HERE: WUYS NHL Man Madness 2016 Bracket Challenge</a> </strong>(You don&#8217;t have to enter your email. Just hit Begin.)</p>
<p>UPDATE: If you voted before 10PM EST on Sunday night, I forgot to include Jamie Benn vs. Jordan Eberle. Probably because that&#8217;s like choosing cake or a different cake. I mean, how can you want just one? You can try here, in <strong><a href="https://surveyplanet.com/56ef55a35a3845081e47e763">Oops, Jamie Benn vs Jordan Eberle</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>You have until Wednesday night to vote</strong>, and we&#8217;ll move into the Semifinals on Thursday!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kidding! Okay, not really. An in-goal wine rack? If you went inside my brain like <em>Being John Malkovich</em>, you&#8217;d find yourself climbing one of these. Somebody get the creator of this miracle a Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>Also, Cnada provided us with this, courtesy of the Vancouver Canucks:</p>

<p>Mamma mia. Lip sync battle is the greatest entertainment invention since the Puppy Bowl, and that&#8217;s even when Beyonce doesn&#8217;t show up. It&#8217;s also the highest art form I participate in daily. From my car.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s be honest. I don&#8217;t know who any of these Canucks rookies are. And I am generally terrified of potential humiliation, so watching this was not easy! But I know all these songs and I must say, these guys nailed it.</p>
<div id="attachment_22701" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-22701" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/nucks5-500x302.png" alt="It's 5 O'Clock somewhere... in Canada.

Because he&#8217;s 19.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jake Virtanen did Alan Jackson&#8217;s &#8220;Chattahoochee&#8221; in a pair of pants that maybe fit him in high school. Good thing he didn&#8217;t pick a song with any booty-dropping or we&#8217;d have seen somebody&#8217;s Chattahoochee.</p>
<div id="attachment_22702" style="width: 373px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-22702" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/nucks6.png" alt="Ain't nothing but a heartache." width="363" height="404" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/nucks6.png 363w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/nucks6-270x300.png 270w" sizes="(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ain&#8217;t nothing but a heartache.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jared McCann (hi cutie!) went straight for our own hearts with some BSB. God, I love this song. It makes no sense &#8211; are they happy? Sad? They never want to hear us say we want it that way? But I thought they <em>did</em> want it that way?</p>
<p>Typical guys, with their mixed messages and wearing all-white in airports.</p>
<div id="attachment_22700" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-22700 size-large" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/nucks4-500x280.png" alt="nucks4" width="500" height="280" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/nucks4-500x280.png 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/nucks4-300x168.png 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/nucks4.png 788w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Canada&#8217;s Got, well&#8230; confidence is a talent, right?</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ben Hutton went all out with his choice of Aqua&#8217;s &#8220;Barbie Girl.&#8221; He was approximately a fetus when this song was released (okay, he was 4), but clearly this musical milestone resonates across the generations.</p>
<p>Admit it, you were worried at the start of Ben&#8217;s number. We were on the fast track to this for a hot second&#8230;.</p>
<div id="attachment_22705" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-22705 size-full" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/napoleon2.gif" alt="napoleon2" width="500" height="245" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Vote for Pedro</p></div>
<p>Until this happened.</p>
<div id="attachment_22699" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-22699 size-large" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/nucks3-500x278.png" alt="Come on Barbie, let's go party." width="500" height="278" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/nucks3-500x278.png 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/nucks3-300x167.png 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/nucks3.png 571w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Come on Barbie, let&#8217;s go party.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last, in the always-unfortunate slot after someone unbottons clothing, Sven Baertschi hit us with some Marvin Gaye. He doesn&#8217;t really know what the host is saying, or what the words are, or that he&#8217;s dressed like AJ McLean, so I assumed he&#8217;d be the one singing Backstreet Boys. Throw is some skating-ish dance moves and you&#8217;ve got yourself a fine performance, friend.</p>
<div id="attachment_22703" style="width: 487px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-22703" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/nucks7.png" alt="He'll be there in a hurry." width="477" height="323" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/nucks7.png 477w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/nucks7-300x203.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">He&#8217;ll be there in a hurry.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was no winner, though I think Sven had it in the bag with his turtleneck and chain. Did he confuse Marvin Gaye with The Lonely Island? I almost hope he did. I also hope more teams subject their players to forced participation for our amusement soon. Right after they give Chuck and I a good twenty minutes with that goal-sized wine rack.</p>
<p>So, in summary, you should vote for Canada. They&#8217;re the country of hockey-themed liquor cabinets and freestyle dancing by untrained white men. If that&#8217;s not the place for me and Chuck, then just leave us the wine.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To commemorate the week so far (and so I don&#8217;t have to go scrolling through Twitter in two years when I want to reference this), a post about two really important things.</p>
<p><strong>Jonathan Toews joined Twitter.</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_22683" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-22683" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/twitter-Toews-500x247.jpg" alt="If you use &quot;eh&quot; in a sentence, you are exempt from needing punctuation." width="500" height="247" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/twitter-Toews-500x247.jpg 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/twitter-Toews-300x148.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/twitter-Toews.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">If you use &#8220;eh&#8221; in a sentence, you are exempt from all grammar rules.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spent my drive to work trying to come up with a joke about how now, we all have to pronounce the &#8220;w&#8221; in Twitter as a &#8220;v&#8221;, like in Toews. I didn&#8217;t quite get there.</p>
<div id="attachment_22688" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-22688 size-large" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/toews2-500x207.png" alt="toews2" width="500" height="207" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/toews2-500x207.png 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/toews2-300x124.png 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/toews2.png 999w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Most Canadian cover photo ever.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, Jon has made fun of Andrew Shaw (check), apologized for a loss (check) and &#8211; I swear you can&#8217;t make this up &#8211; used &#8220;jk.&#8221; He is basically us at age 14, only Andrew Shaw was (probably) not born yet.</p>
<div id="attachment_22686" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-22686 size-large" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/toews-500x232.png" alt="toews" width="500" height="232" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/toews-500x232.png 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/toews-300x139.png 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/toews.png 514w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The only capital letter Toews cares about is the C on his sweater.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember when Jonathan Toews was no fun? Like, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">at all</span>? He even went as Grumpy for Halloween&#8230; which was ironic, because referencing his grumpiness was one of the first steps toward casting it off. If it were 2012, we would hardly recognize this guy.</p>
<div id="attachment_22690" style="width: 394px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-22690 size-full" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/toews31.jpg" alt="toews3" width="384" height="384" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/toews31.jpg 384w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/toews31-150x150.jpg 150w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/toews31-300x300.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/toews31-96x96.jpg 96w" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Part-time model profile pic</p></div>

<p>In related news, everyone loves Jonathan Toews. More than ever.

<p>And remember, we are communication professionals. Will work for hockey.</p>
<div id="attachment_22691" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-22691 size-large" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/wuys-500x155.png" alt="wuys" width="500" height="155" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/wuys-500x155.png 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/wuys-300x93.png 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/wuys.png 577w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Pro tip.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other important thing for future reference (and Chromecasting onto a big screen):</p>
<p><strong>The Penguins played horseshoes. #shirtsoptional</strong></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Maybe I shouldn&#8217;t be looking at my phone while walking. But honestly, Pittsburgh, warn a girl! I may have veered wildly across a sidewalk during DC rush hour upon seeing this grace my screen. The video loaded. Wifi buffered. Particle beams shot through space and a satellite fell from the sky but still I COULD NOT WATCH IT.</p>
<p>So I went into the nearby hotel lobby and calmly stole the password from their reception desk.</p>
<div id="attachment_22694" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-22694 size-large" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/pens-3-500x282.png" alt="pens 3" width="500" height="282" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/pens-3-500x282.png 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/pens-3-300x169.png 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/pens-3.png 546w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Julia informs me this is Brian Dumolin. My eyes were seared by Sid&#8217;s paleness.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a new appreciation for horseshoes. Previously a game I&#8217;ve only seen played by small cousins and large rednecks, it suddenly seems a pursuit worth dedicating my life to. On this beach, with the lovely crystal waves crashing.</p>
<div id="attachment_22693" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-22693 size-large" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/pens-2-500x278.png" alt="pens 2" width="500" height="278" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/pens-2-500x278.png 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/pens-2-300x167.png 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/pens-2.png 553w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">And maybe even one day, a tan.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this whole hockey thing doesn&#8217;t work out for the Pens, they could always open an off-season Club Med.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pittsburgh, currently holding the last Wild Card spot in the East, plays at Boston tomorrow night on NBCSN. The Hawks, who are first in the West, host Nashville on Thursday night on the same network. Two nights of Roenick and Milbury&#8230; might almost be worth it for all this.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had something clever to say about the Carolina Hurricane&#8217;s Justin Faulk , but really, this sums it all up.</p>
<p><strong>Foxy Friday: Justin Faulk</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_22667" style="width: 442px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-22667" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk.png" alt="Cuddle Puddle!" width="432" height="361" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk.png 432w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk-300x251.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Cuddle Puddle!</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, yeah. We&#8217;re talking about hockey!</p>
<p>Justin Faulk is 23, American from Minnesota, plays defense and was the Canes&#8217; sole representative at this year&#8217;s NHL All Star Game. He also appeared in last year&#8217;s ASG.</p>
<p>That concludes 100% of what I know about him. Back to the internet, Alex.</p>
<div id="attachment_22668" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-22668 size-full" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk3.jpg" alt="faulk3" width="400" height="500" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk3.jpg 400w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk3-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">In November, we captioned this: &#8220;Justin Faulk is really, really sorry that his hands are so big and his hair is so tousled.&#8221; Still true.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.si.com/nhl/2016/01/12/justin-faulk-carolina-hurricanes">SI.com featured Faulk in January</a>, mentioning that he is putting together a potentially historic goal total this season. Not his 15 goals overall, but the fact that 12 of them are power play goals. If he can get to 20 PPG, he&#8217;ll be the first defenseman to ever do so in a single season. In the story, you can read how Justin&#8217;s mom credits repeated watchings of <em>The Mighty Ducks</em> with teaching Justin to skate.</p>
<p>Hey, that movie is probably to blame for our hockey careers too.</p>
<div id="attachment_22669" style="width: 458px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-22669" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk2.jpg" alt="Does Spidey have hors, or..." width="448" height="448" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk2.jpg 448w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk2-150x150.jpg 150w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk2-300x300.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk2-96x96.jpg 96w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Does Spidey have horns, or&#8230;</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Faulk won an NCAA championship with Univ. of Minnesota Duluth and was part of the 2014 US Olympic Team, where he took part in possibly the most inexplicable portrait shoot ever.</p>
<div id="attachment_22670" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-22670 size-large" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/olympic1-500x373.jpg" alt="olympic1" width="500" height="373" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/olympic1-500x373.jpg 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/olympic1-300x224.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/olympic1.jpg 687w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Zoolander 2, in theaters today.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, actually, I&#8217;ve seen this before.</p>
<div id="attachment_22671" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-22671 size-full" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/joey.gif" alt="Damn, I was going for 'thoughtful.'" width="500" height="242" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Damn, I was going for &#8216;thoughtful.&#8217;</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Justin&#8217;s amassed quite a collection of facial scars in his young career, and isn&#8217;t afraid to selfie them for your benefit. I&#8217;ll put <a href="https://twitter.com/justinfaulk27/status/275377037491986432">that photo behind this link</a>. Instead, you can see how they&#8217;ve healed up just enough to give him that hockey player look we like so much.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/F1ZKGFcYP2I?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>It took me a minute to figure out why I like Justin Faulk, then I realized that, while bearded, he strongly resembles the guy who plays Aramis on BBC&#8217;s <em>The Musketeers</em>. Aramis was always my favorite Musketeer, and it is my favorite book of all time.</p>
<div id="attachment_22672" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-22672 size-full" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk4.gif" alt="faulk4" width="480" height="270" /><p class="wp-caption-text">gif from <a href="http://nhl-canes.tumblr.com/post/137730748214/the-eyebrows-strike-again">nhl-canes.tumblr.com</a></p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right? This is a renaissance faire waiting to happen.</p>
<div id="attachment_22673" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-22673 size-full" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/aramis.gif" alt="aramis" width="500" height="230" /><p class="wp-caption-text">BBC America posted <a href="https://www.facebook.com/themusketeersbbctvshow/photos/a.222714194535011.1073741827.222011417938622/639287656210994/?type=3&amp;theater">THIS </a>but no Series 3 date. Bloody hell.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Justin is only 23, he&#8217;s tried a number of styles in his search of what would look best on the NHL ASG red carpet.</p>
<div id="attachment_22674" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-22674 size-large" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulky-500x247.jpg" alt="faulky" width="500" height="247" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulky-500x247.jpg 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulky-300x148.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulky.jpg 547w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">I&#8217;m relaxed. No wait, I&#8217;m serious. Defensemen don&#8217;t relax.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They all more or less work for him, with the exception of his audition for the role of immediately-post <em>My So Called Life</em> <del>Jordan Catalano</del> Jared Leto. Everyone tried this bleached blond thing, no one succeeded. We were all young too &#8211; we just had the sense to do it before the internet.</p>
<div id="attachment_22675" style="width: 409px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-22675" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk5.jpg" alt="For the record, Rayanne was a bitch." width="399" height="361" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk5.jpg 399w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk5-300x271.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">For the record, Rayanne was a bitch.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Justin is on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/justinfaulk27">@justinfaulk27</a>, with a banner photo that a) reminds you how many friends people have at 23 and b) promises shirtless boat selfies may not be out of the question.</p>
<div id="attachment_22677" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-22677 size-large" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk7-500x262.jpg" alt="faulk7" width="500" height="262" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk7-500x262.jpg 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk7-300x157.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk7.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Okay, I&#8217;m serious. No, wait. Models aren&#8217;t serious.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, if you don&#8217;t already like Justin Faulk for histalent, you can like him because his hair and eyebrows will always look better than yours. It&#8217;s nice to know which battles you can&#8217;t win, right? And if that&#8217;s not enough, the guy folds his clothes.</p>
<div id="attachment_22676" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-22676" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk-tweet-500x382.png" alt="You can be the spatial reasoning in this relationship." width="500" height="382" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk-tweet-500x382.png 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk-tweet-300x229.png 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk-tweet.png 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">You can be the spatial reasoning in this relationship.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let a married person tell you: Marry someone who folds his clothes.</p>
<p>Now let a married person read that out loud to her husband.</p>
<div id="attachment_22678" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-22678" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk1-500x336.jpg" alt="My eyebrows get uneven too, friend." width="500" height="336" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk1-500x336.jpg 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk1-300x202.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk1.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">My eyebrows get uneven too, friend.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just realized the Canes play the Penguins tonight. Why am I out to sabotage my team with the power of Foxy Friday every time?! Last week it was Stamkos, who had 2A in Tampa&#8217;s win over Pittsburgh. Damn it, it&#8217;s too late now. Apologies in advance.</p>
<div id="attachment_22679" style="width: 458px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-22679" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk21.jpg" alt="80's lighting, 90's hair" width="448" height="467" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk21.jpg 448w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk21-288x300.jpg 288w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">80&#8217;s lighting, 90&#8217;s hair</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With 57 points, you could look at the Canes&#8217; season as a half-full or half-empty situation. They&#8217;re next-to-last in the Metro Division and four spots back of a wild card berth. Or they are just four points out of a playoff spot with 30 games to go. It&#8217;s a jam up in the East and should be an exciting. sickening. panic-inducing run for the end of the regular season. Please let Foxy Friday bestow no powers on this one day.</p>
<div id="attachment_22680" style="width: 448px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-22680" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/faulk22.jpg" alt="Don't ruin the magic, please.

<p>Bahahasnortlaughahaha! <strong>PHIL-ings!</strong> I&#8217;ve got Phil-ings about your bowl haircut and what you insist on wearing, Kessel, but nothing this funny. I see him laughing at all the guys traded to/from the Leafs today, while at the same time silently shaking his head, &#8220;No, God no!&#8221; at Stamkos.</p>
<p>This one also made me snarf. The word &#8220;horn&#8221; always makes me laugh like a 7th grader in health class-slash-Georgia Nicholson.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s not as good or true as this:</p>

<p>Here are <a href="http://penguins.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=110968&amp;cmpid=pit-fb-penguins">all the Penguins Valentine&#8217;s</a>. Honorable mention for the adoration derp they caught on Kris Letang&#8217;s face:</p>
<div id="attachment_22661" style="width: 379px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-22661" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tanger.png" alt="Me, when I see the sign for In-N-Out Burger." width="369" height="365" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tanger.png 369w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tanger-300x297.png 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tanger-96x96.png 96w" sizes="(max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Me, when I see the sign for In-N-Out Burger.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You know I hate to say it, but some of these Flyers Valentine&#8217;s are pretty funny. If you&#8217;re into orange and liking things you hate.</p>
<div id="attachment_22665" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-22665 size-full" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/flyers.png" alt="flyers" width="452" height="358" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/flyers.png 452w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/flyers-300x238.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Cupid Giroux should have matching wrist casts.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I assume <a href="http://lightning.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=103955">these Bolts cards </a>are from 2016, because if people have been saying &#8220;bae&#8221; for over a year I&#8217;ll feel even more despair about American culture. (Update: These are from last year. I give up on you, American youth.)</p>
<div id="attachment_22664" style="width: 308px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-22664 size-full" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tampa-bae.png" alt="tampa bae" width="298" height="300" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tampa-bae.png 298w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tampa-bae-150x150.png 150w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tampa-bae-96x96.png 96w" sizes="(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">When the NHL adopts it, you know a trend is over.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did I miss any teams that have 2016 cards? The Predators did Valentines last year [<a href="http://predators.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=753147">link</a>], but I&#8217;m not sure how they could top the weird and scared feeling this conveyed:</p>
<div id="attachment_22663" style="width: 375px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-22663" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/gnash.png" alt="There are conventions for this kind of mascot stuff." width="365" height="368" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/gnash.png 365w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/gnash-150x150.png 150w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/gnash-298x300.png 298w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/gnash-96x96.png 96w" sizes="(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">There are conventions for this kind of mascot stuff.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be on the lookout for more cards this week, even thought all our PHIL-ings may be committed already.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is a little known major oversight here at WUYS that Steven Stamkos has never been a Foxy Friday. One could argue that&#8217;s he&#8217;s been sufficiently fox-ied every other day of the week, since we&#8217;ve tagged over 100 posts with his name. But with great power comes great responsibility&#8230;</p>
<p>To keep looking like this:</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/zdLEpJrg5iI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Some of our 100+ Stamkos posts have been pretty legendary, including those times he:</p>
<p>&#8230; was so cute at 20 that I said, &#8220;<a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2010/11/17/now-later-steven-stamkos/">Call me when you don’t need a fake ID</a>.&#8217;</p>
<p>.. <a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2011/02/08/birthday-boy-steven-stamkos/">turned 21</a>. Then <a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2012/02/07/birthday-boy-steven-stamkos-2/">22,</a> and then <a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2013/02/07/birthday-boy-steven-stamkos-3/">23</a>. (He&#8217;s 25 now.)</p>
<p>&#8230; <a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2012/12/11/think-snow/">shoveled snow in shorts</a>.</p>
<p>&#8230; wore, and I mean <em>wore</em>, <a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2013/08/02/foxy-friday-these-pants/">blue pants to play golf</a>. The <a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2013/07/25/chip-shots/">white pants</a> were good too.</p>
<p>&#8230; and James Neal <a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2011/09/22/intern-jeff-skinner-ftw/">cried laughing at Intern Jeff Skinner</a>&#8216;s mortal humiliation.</p>
<p>&#8230; scored <a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2012/03/14/five-o/">50 goals</a>. Then made it <a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2012/04/09/sixty-for-stamkos/">60 goals</a>.</p>
<p>&#8230; did this:<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22641" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/steven.gif" alt="steven" width="300" height="160" /></p>
<p>&#8230; pretended to forget his skates while Jordan Eberle pretended to be mean in a <a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2014/03/06/moment-hero/">Coke Zero commerical</a>.</p>
<p>&#8230; and Neal, Tavares and Jeff Carter had an <a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2013/03/07/on-the-hottest-ticket-now/">imaginary argument about the scoring race</a>.</p>
<p>&#8230; <a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2011/06/03/ready-for-my-close-up/">Tweeted a photo</a> of his busted face.</p>
<p>&#8230; <a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2012/08/31/foxy-friday-workout-videos/">jumped freakishly high</a>. Which is probably all the time.</p>
<p>&#8230; cut/didn&#8217;t cut <a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2012/05/25/beauty-school-dropout/">his hair</a>.</p>
<p>&#8230; <a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2014/08/14/foxy-almost-friday-ice-bucket-challenge/">poured water of himself</a> in the name of charity.</p>
<p>&#8230; went to the wire on a <a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2011/06/30/what-are-you-waiting-for/">contract deal</a>. No, the other time.</p>
<div id="attachment_22642" style="width: 505px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-22642" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stam5.png" alt="Curls for the girls" width="495" height="366" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stam5.png 495w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stam5-300x222.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Curls for the girls</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been 4 years, 7 months and 22 days since Steven&#8217;s first mention on WUYS. That means he&#8217;s gone 1697 days without being Foxy Friday! Criminal! Finally, we correct this error of 242.5 weeks. (And on a day that Steven and the Bolts play Pittsburgh. I waited 5 years to probably shoot myself in the foot and cost my team their whole season. Yay,)</p>
<p>In honor of Steven finally being named, we&#8217;re bringing you ALL NEW (to this blog, mostly, we think) Steven Stamkos content! Skinny legs and all.</p>

<p>When he&#8217;s not on the ice, you can find him being cute with a puppy:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And with many puppies:</p>

<p>And with his own puppy:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>or product placement:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find him hanging with his related Tumblr searches:</p>
<div id="attachment_22652" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-22652 size-large" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/related-500x48.png" alt="related" width="500" height="48" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/related-500x48.png 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/related-300x29.png 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/related.png 631w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">I&#8217;ve got friends in Southern Ontario places&#8230;</p></div>

<div id="attachment_22649" style="width: 439px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-22649 size-full" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stam10.png" alt="stam10" width="429" height="427" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stam10.png 429w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stam10-150x150.png 150w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stam10-300x300.png 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stam10-96x96.png 96w" sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Notice that &#8220;Hand&#8221; is the only thing capitalized.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And most importantly, doing activities:</p>
<div id="attachment_22645" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-22645 size-large" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stam3-500x280.png" alt="stam3" width="500" height="280" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stam3-500x280.png 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stam3-300x168.png 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stam3.png 568w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">I play Frisbee every day with my dog, I could coach this. Will work for everyone&#8217;s shirts.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could go on all day (or for the past five years). Stammer&#8217;s contract is up at the end of this season, and the drama is already at peak hysteria. The Lightning have said it&#8217;s their &#8220;number one priority&#8221; &#8211; well, <em>duh</em>. Steven has said little other than he loves playing in Tampa. We&#8217;ve heard guys say that and take reasonable contracts to stay put, or shout is as they&#8217;re rolling toward a new team in an armored truck full of cash. My bet is on Stamkos staying with the Lightning.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/Nl4YshqM4Zc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not already following him on twitter (@<a href="https://twitter.com/RealStamkos91">RealStamkos91</a>), you&#8217;re doing it wrong. The guy knows what we want! It&#8217;s almost as good as the Steven Stamkos Tumblr feed.</p>
<p>Happy finally Foxy Friday, Steven. Try not to score too many again the Penguins tonight, yeah? Kthanksbye.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I pity the fool who answers the NHL TV customer service line when I call today. Well, the person won&#8217;t be a fool, nor can they actually do anything about the disaster of a changeover from Game Center Live. But still. I don&#8217;t pay $150 a year to miss Sidney Crosby hat tricks!</p>
<p>Last night, Sid scored three very necessary goals to lead the Penguins to a 6-5 victory over Ottawa.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/8R00IikN7nM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>I won&#8217;t take credit for this particular scoring surge, but ask Lindsay if it might be the result of a conversation we had yesterday. I once ended the lockout, you know.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is a sign for the Pens, who currently hold the last EC wild card slot. The East is all jammed up: seven teams within two points, and all for third in the division.</p>
<div id="attachment_22637" style="width: 428px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-22637" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/east.png" alt="Look at that goal differential . Holy Caps." width="418" height="475" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/east.png 418w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/east-264x300.png 264w" sizes="(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Look at that goal differential . Holy Caps.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Monday, Sid told press, &#8220;Our playoffs basically start now.&#8221; And he kinda smiled when he said it. [<a href="https://www.nhl.com/penguins/video/off-day-sidney-crosby/t-277443440/c-40680303">Video</a>]</p>
<div id="attachment_22634" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-22634" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sid-500x303.png" alt="Somebody got a new hat." width="500" height="303" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sid-500x303.png 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sid-300x182.png 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sid.png 605w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Somebody got a new hat.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While you were enjoying the Penguins goals and wondering WTAF they were doing between goals, I was practicing yoga with this Sid workout clip.</p>
<div style="width: 450px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-22633-1" width="450" height="226" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/yoga-sid.mp4?_=1" /><a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/yoga-sid.mp4">http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/yoga-sid.mp4</a></video></div>
<p style="text-align: center;">(Bless <a href="https://twitter.com/Kiki5851">@Kiki5851</a> for finding this.)</p>
<p>Except I only managed Shavasana, where you lay on the floor looking dead while trying to compose yourself. I have elite skills.</p>
<div id="attachment_22636" style="width: 206px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-22636" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sid2.jpg" alt="Bonus feature." width="196" height="465" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sid2.jpg 196w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sid2-126x300.jpg 126w" sizes="(max-width: 196px) 100vw, 196px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Bonus feature.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, the Twitters told me that freshly-returned-from-injury Connor McDavid did this:</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/-9ru_R7Qjjo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Well, shit. That is an amazing goal. Tell me again what you were doing in 1997, when he was born? My Home Ec class egg baby is older than Connor McDavid. (Haha, #TeamEggBaby it is!)</p>
<p>Alas, I saw no actual hockey AGAIN. I will be sending this post to the suggestion box at NHL TV &#8211; which probably does work, because obviously.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Once upon a time there was an All-Star Weekend that reminded me how much I love hockey.  Well, that happens every year. But this weekend, like so much of this season, I didn&#8217;t actually get to watch anything. GAH! What follows is the best I was able to mash up from Twitter and my imagination&#8230; except I couldn&#8217;t make this up:</p>
<p dir="ltr">It was someone&#8217;s job to walk behind John Tavares and hold a sign that said &#8220;John Tavares.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_22623" style="width: 427px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-22623" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/signJT.png" alt="I demand to see your qualifications." width="417" height="351" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/signJT.png 417w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/signJT-300x253.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">I demand to see your qualifications.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is so obviously the job for me that I&#8217;m just putting it on my resume, because it makes no sense that I wasn&#8217;t the one to do it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WtU8FGza4">Here&#8217;s the red carpet video</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_22624" style="width: 433px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-22624 size-full" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/signJT2.png" alt="signJT2" width="423" height="355" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/signJT2.png 423w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/signJT2-300x252.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Gives new meaning to &#8220;Climb the ladder at work.&#8221;</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could also have held the &#8220;PLAID SUIT!&#8221; sign, people.</p>
<div id="attachment_22629" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-22629" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stammer-500x352.png" alt="They don't call him &quot;Stammer&quot; for nothing." width="500" height="352" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stammer-500x352.png 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stammer-300x211.png 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stammer.png 545w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">They don&#8217;t call him &#8220;Stammer&#8221; for nothing.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, let me just get this out of the way:</p>
<div id="attachment_22605" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-22605" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/boys-500x348.png" alt="Squad goals." width="500" height="348" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/boys-500x348.png 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/boys-300x209.png 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/boys.png 832w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Squad goals.</p></div>
<p dir="ltr">And by &#8220;this&#8221;, I mean my dead body, fallen to the ground, blocking everyone&#8217;s commute into DC. Look at these guys! Look at John&#8217;s hair! My enjoyment of this photo is the way a tween feels on the day a new One Direction album drops. I don&#8217;t Snapchat, but if I did, I would express this with the &#8220;throwing up rainbows&#8221; filter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If this were <em>The Hangover</em>, Tavares would end up with the tattoo on his face. Take care of him!</p>
<div id="attachment_22606" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-22606" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/scott1-500x282.jpg" alt="Hockey clubs can't even handle me right now." width="500" height="282" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/scott1-500x282.jpg 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/scott1-300x169.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/scott1.jpg 669w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hockey clubs can&#8217;t even handle me right now.</p></div>
<p dir="ltr">Obviously the big story of the weekend was John Scott auditioning to play himself in the Disney remake of <em>Goon</em>. He not only went to Nashville, apprently against the NHL&#8217;s wishes, he owned the weekend. His kids and goals and his MVP award are all the things we love about sports. Perseverance, faith and, hey, talent (!) delivered with a smile that thanked most people and told some others to kiss his ass.</p>
<div id="attachment_22608" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-22608" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/scott3.gif" alt="Proudest fan club." width="300" height="168" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Proudest fan club.</p></div>
<p dir="ltr">The support of so many players and teams for Scott&#8217;s efforts was also spectacular. Sportsmanship, alive and well! This is what sports should teach kids: not that everybody wins, or gets a trophy for showing up, but that life can be tough &#8211; and you can be tougher.  Scott goes, for now, back to the AHL. Fate awaits. But for that moment, when someone said he couldn&#8217;t, John Scott did anyway. Bravo, sir.</p>
<div id="attachment_22607" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-22607" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/scott2-500x331.jpg" alt="This is the moment, tonight is the night..." width="500" height="331" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/scott2-500x331.jpg 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/scott2-300x198.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/scott2.jpg 644w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">This is the moment, tonight is the night&#8230;</p></div>
<p dir="ltr">In other highlights, PK Subban topped the moment he wore Intern Jeff Skinner&#8217;s jersey with a costume so perfect I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve never worn it on Halloween. (No wig required.)</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/aYzU4oMVVRY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">And PK looks good with long hair. Is that weird? Nah. These rest of the weekend PK dressed and acted like a million bucks-slash-his regular self. He even does a purple suit and fedora with a minimum of pimp-ness. How?</p>
<div id="attachment_22609" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-22609" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/subban2-500x232.jpg" alt="Most popular man on campus" width="500" height="232" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/subban2-500x232.jpg 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/subban2-300x139.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/subban2.jpg 996w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Most popular man on campus</p></div>
<p dir="ltr">In the weekend&#8217;s other best piece of performance art, Brent Burns appeared as the fictionalized version of himself.</p>
<div id="attachment_22610" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-22610" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/burns-chewie-2-500x349.jpg" alt="&quot;Where my boyfriend?&quot; - Maz Kanata" width="500" height="349" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/burns-chewie-2-500x349.jpg 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/burns-chewie-2-300x210.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/burns-chewie-2.jpg 511w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Where my boyfriend?&#8221; &#8211; Maz Kanata</p></div>
<p dir="ltr">Plus he brought a litle Ewok.</p>
<div id="attachment_22611" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-22611" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/lil-burns-500x325.jpg" alt="Anyone else's biological clock ticking like a bomb?" width="500" height="325" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/lil-burns-500x325.jpg 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/lil-burns-300x195.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/lil-burns.jpg 714w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Biological clocks ticking so loudly, someone called the Bomb Squad.</p></div>
<p dir="ltr">Burns&#8217; teammate and Former Foxy Friday Joe Pavelski also brought his son, and Minis Pavelski and Burns scored a goal in the breakaway competition. That drop pass would make any goalie disappear.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/f_0utB0nQPc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Jeez, Pavelski looks good. Sorry Chuck, but I think Joe Thornton turned out to be the Prince William in this family, and all of a sudden Prince  Harry (ginger power! ) is like <em>woah</em>.</p>
<div id="attachment_22612" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-22612" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/pavelski-500x366.jpg" alt="Do you know the way to San Jose?" width="500" height="366" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/pavelski-500x366.jpg 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/pavelski-300x220.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/pavelski.jpg 552w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Do you know the way to San Jose?</p></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello?</p>
<div id="attachment_22589" style="width: 625px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-22589 size-full" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cb-gif.gif" alt="What is this gif? I've been watching it for 20 mins and I'm crying." width="615" height="385" /><p class="wp-caption-text">What is this gif? I&#8217;ve been watching it for 20 mins and I&#8217;m crying.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HI GUYS! Remember me? I was wondering if after all these years you&#8217;d like to meet and go over half a season of hockey that I&#8217;ve mostly missed. How does this happen? My life is like space in <em>Interstellar</em>, where time barely passes, while hockey and this blog remain on Earth, getting 80 years older every day without me.</p>
<p>So, All-Star Game?</p>
<p>Is anyone watching this? I kinda sorta almost totally forgot about it until someone mentioned John  Tavares&#8217; pants.</p>
<div id="attachment_22590" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-22590" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/pants-500x504.png" alt="@JennMJones531 to the rescue." width="500" height="504" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/pants-500x504.png 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/pants-150x150.png 150w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/pants-297x300.png 297w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/pants-96x96.png 96w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/pants.png 576w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">@JennMJones531 to the rescue.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That will get my attention, even from space.</p>
<div id="attachment_22591" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-22591 size-full" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/martian.gif" alt="Mixing space movie metaphors!! (Spends five hours looking at Matt Damon gifs.)" width="800" height="329" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mixing space movie metaphors!! (Spends five hours looking at Matt Damon gifs.)</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, Crosby didn&#8217;t get invited. That&#8217;s old news. I wrote a mental blog post called &#8220;10 Things Sid Can Do Instead of the ASG&#8221;, which was quite funny.  You should read it sometime when you develop mind-reading powers.  Or tomorrow, if I get around to posting it.</p>
<p>The newer news is Ovi and Toews are hurt/sick and also suspended. The NHL sure knows how to cry when the whole class doesn&#8217;t come to their party.</p>
<div id="attachment_22593" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-22593 size-full" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/nene.gif" alt="nene" width="500" height="281" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Truth hurts, ASG.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alas, with no drunken draft, most of the fun is gone from the weekend anyway. The NHL has realized this too late and made some replacement efforts to attract our attention:</p>
<p><strong>1) Made John Tavares captain.</strong> He probably suggested this <em>Footloose</em>-inspired sobriety nonsense, for fear a real charitable organization might think Ovi was actually poor and needed a new car. The paperwork on that tax headache!  But it does mean more camera time for Captain T and the Pleated Pants.</p>
<div id="attachment_22594" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-22594" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/captains-500x316.jpg" alt="Does this data come in a pie chart?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2) Dierks Bentley.</strong> HOLLER. I love country music, and Dierks is a big Preds fan, and everybody likes tight jeans. He&#8217;ll be one of the celeb coaches at the game.</p>
<div id="attachment_22596" style="width: 352px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-22596" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/dierks2.jpg" alt="We would get drunk on this plane." width="342" height="368" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/dierks2.jpg 342w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/dierks2-279x300.jpg 279w" sizes="(max-width: 342px) 100vw, 342px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">We would get drunk on this plane.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3) All the Foxy Fridays</strong>. Damn if they didn&#8217;t replace Toews with <a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2012/08/24/foxy-friday-james-neal/">James Neal</a>. The NHL knew I wasn&#8217;t paying attention and just waved a <del>red</del> ginger flag in my face.</p>
<div id="attachment_22598" style="width: 255px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-22598" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/neal2.gif" alt="endsmile" width="245" height="370" /><p class="wp-caption-text">endsmile</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Add that to <a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2011/04/29/foxy-friday-pekka-rinne/">Pekka Rinne</a>, <a href="https://whatsupyasieve.wordpress.com/2011/01/21/foxy-friday-shea-weber/">Shea Weber</a> and all-time FF fave, <a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2014/01/03/foxy-friday-roman-josi/">Roman Josi</a>, and the home team is, um, <em><strong>well</strong></em> represented.  Other Foxy Fridays on the roster: Jamie Benn, Matt Duchene, Patrick Kane, Tyler Seguin, Jonathan Quick, Patrice Bergeron, Ryan O&#8217;Reilly, Ben Bishop, Claude Giroux, <em>holy crap are we there yet?</em>, Evgeni Malkin, the aforementioned John Tavares, CPA, His Disney Highness Kris Letang, Ryan McDonaugh and Braden Holtby.</p>
<div id="attachment_22599" style="width: 420px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-22599" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/gingeroux.png" alt="Answer: Making Pants hate herself." width="410" height="454" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/gingeroux.png 410w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/gingeroux-271x300.png 271w" sizes="(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Answer: Making Pants hate herself.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Stamkos, #TeamHall and Nicky Backstrom have never been Foxy Fridays. This blog is a sham. Shut it down.</p>
<div id="attachment_22600" style="width: 394px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-22600" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/stammer.jpg" alt="What kind of irresponsible journalism is this?!" width="384" height="512" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/stammer.jpg 384w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/stammer-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">What kind of irresponsible journalism is this?!</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4) 3-on-3 Format.</strong> I won&#8217;t pretend to have an opinion on this, as I&#8217;ve watched approximately one OT period all season, but it sounds exciting. Top players + more open ice = more goals, right? But hasn&#8217;t the All-Star Game always ended in some Hobbit score of twelveses to eleventy anyway? Maybe the &#8220;last place in the draft&#8221; prize can be repurposed to the only player who doesn&#8217;t score a hat trick on Sunday.</p>
<div id="attachment_22601" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-22601" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ovi-500x337.jpg" alt="Ovi wasn't picked last, but someone did give him a car to donate to charity." width="500" height="337" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ovi-500x337.jpg 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ovi-300x202.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ovi.jpg 503w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ovi wasn&#8217;t last, but someone did <a href="http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/02/alex-ovechkin-finally-gets-the-car-he-wanted-at-the-nhl-all-star-draft">give him a car to donate to charity</a>.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5) The John Scott story.</strong> Voted into the ASG by fans, then traded and assigned to the AHL, the saga of whether or not John Scott would appear in the ASG has been ongoing news. Yesterday, Scott published<a href="http://www.theplayerstribune.com/a-guy-like-me/"> this first person account in The Player&#8217;s Tribune</a>. In it, he explains how someone from the NHL encouraged him, even now, not to attend this weekend&#8217;s events.</p>
<p>SCREW YOU, NHL. Wrong, bad, stupid, and also, WHY? John Scott may be the only player who actually cares about this game, and you think he should stay home? Do you think the fans who voted him in should not watch? Oh no, you want them. You NEED them.</p>
<div id="attachment_22602" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-22602" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/scott-500x398.jpg" alt="She'll be proud." width="500" height="398" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/scott-500x398.jpg 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/scott-300x239.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/scott.jpg 530w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">She&#8217;ll be proud.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read the Player&#8217;s Tribune story. It will make you want to buy a John Scott jersey and stand up in your living room when he takes the ice on Sunday. I hope every player shows up wearing his name. You may not like Scott&#8217;s brand of hockey, but it is part of hockey. Scott may not be an elite player, but he is a player. Was a player? Will be an NHL player again? Who knows. But if you love the game, you have to love it&#8217;s scars.</p>
<p>So, see you guys tomorrow night on the Twitters to techno-judge the real skills at Skills Competition: hair, beard, sass? Our trifecta of All-Star Weekend talents.</p>
