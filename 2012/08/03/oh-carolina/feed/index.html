		<description><![CDATA[I have DEFINITELY been window shopping new shirseys. Methot, L. Schenn, Wolski, Parise, Nash...There&#039;s gonna be a hole in my wallet the size of Crosby&#039;s ass by the time the season starts. On top of all those, there are the players I haven&#039;t gotten around to buying. Anyone willing to offer up some closet space?]]></description>
