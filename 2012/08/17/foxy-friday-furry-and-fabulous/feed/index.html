I can&#039;t stop smiling! The one of Seguin is my wallpaper on my laptop and my phone and my ipod and and and... and I&#039;m a Blackhawks fan, but have been forced to surrender to the adorableness that is Seggy and Puppy!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How could you leave out Karl Alzner &#038; his pooches?
