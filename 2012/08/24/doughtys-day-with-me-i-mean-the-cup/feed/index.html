		<description><![CDATA[Well, all I can say is I&#039;m glad SOMEBODY gave us the real 4-1-1 on what he did with the Cup.  I was wondering why you&#039;d been strangely silent these past few weeks, Dawn.  Your donut stalking has paid off in a huge way, and for this you deserve props x1000.

There&#039;s so much to love about this dweeb.  Please keep singing his praises and in my case, keep on preaching to the choir.  :)]]></description>

In fact, I think this is officially the first time I&#039;ve ever seen what you see in him.  Lord almighty.  First Seguin, now Doughty.  I might be boy crazy.]]></description>
