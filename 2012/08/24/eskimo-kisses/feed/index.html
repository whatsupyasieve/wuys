		<description><![CDATA[How have I never noticed that Rosen looks a lot like former Terrier David Van der Gulik? There&#039;s a previous incarnation of this game show with the class of &#039;09 (Gilroy, McCarthy, Yip, and Smolinsky) if you search back through hockeybuzz, it&#039;s in two parts.

		<description><![CDATA[BU games are so much fun.  We have a great new rink that serves beer (!) and it is really exciting to watch players mature and develop who you know are most likely going to play in the NHL someday.  I can say I knew him when...

There are 61 former Terriers who have played or currently play in the NHL. 6 of them have their name on the Cup.

They&#039;ve also had 10 players picked in the 1st round of the NHL Draft.

GO BU!]]></description>

Chuck, I hope you and your roomie don&#039;t mind me crashing on your couch because I&#039;m totally coming to Boston and I may never leave.

Also, I bet you all A THOUSAND DOLLARS that these boys could not answer these same questions about their girlfriends. &#039;Salright, because a good woman knows that she can never come between her man and his man.]]></description>
