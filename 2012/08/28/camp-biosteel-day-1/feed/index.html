		<description><![CDATA[They lift things up and put them down.
I swoon.

I hope Day 2 has more Tyler Seguin.

Watching this video gives me inspiration for the gym tonight.

I also maintain that BioSteel Sports need to invite us to next year&#039;s camp so we can do video posts.  How hilarious would a montage of us trying to actually do these workouts be?  It would probably just be us lying on the floor sweaty and dead. 

Hey...I might be on to something here.  If we pass out and die, we&#039;ll need mouth to mouth.]]></description>
