		<description><![CDATA[My car was in the shop for two days.  I just got the Nealmobile back and now James Neal appears at camp.  That is not a coincidence, people.

I think red shoelaces are the new black.

Also, Intern Jeff Skinner does some mean inverted push-up things, which I think are called plank pull-ups.  He&#039;s been watching me train all summer for Tough Mudder.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While outwardly Team Peeta, I was kinda also secretly Team Cato in the first book/movie because I&#039;m an awful person so naturally the sprinting sequence totally does it for me. I was also kinda Team Thresh but I don&#039;t think the casting was right as I was hoping in my mind. But I digress.

Also, I know Amanda and I are the only ones who feel this way but, WHERE IS TAYLOR HALL?!? He was supposed to be there.]]></description>
