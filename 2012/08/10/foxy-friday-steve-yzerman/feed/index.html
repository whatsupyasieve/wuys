		<description><![CDATA[Not only is Stevie Y even more adorable as time goes by, his is also one of the smartest hockey minds ever, an incredibly nice guy, and still married to his high school sweetheart. I got to meet him at a Wings game (after he retired) with my niece, who was getting the royal treatment because she was being treated for leukemia (she&#039;s fine now). He was the most down-to-earth, kind person. A picture of the three of us is right by my desk where I can look at it whenever I need inspiration.]]></description>
