		<description><![CDATA[I flew out to Chicago from DC and it was so incredibly more than worth any costs that went into this experience of a lifetime.

I really enjoyed hearing about BHC2012 from the viewpoint of someone who did more panels as opposed to sessions for autographs/pictures! Clearly, I missed out on the SC panel, if I had known I was gonna miss Shawlberg getting ladies all hot and bothered I would have given my pass to the Hull signings to my friend who didn&#039;t win a pass! She and her bf were a few of the people he signed autogrpahs for on Saturday (I was in Shawzy&#039;s autograph line and when they called me I nearly started crying b/c I missed MY hubby Tazer). Since it was my first time though I just wanted to meet as many people as possible, next time I plan on doing more panels/stalking Tazer wherever he goes. I met the rookie bromance on Saturday and they were both so nice, especially Shawzy (you probs saw the picture). They signed my shot glass. AND Shawzy signed the pic I got with him. Yes, it is getting framed (goes without saying).

For me the final day was un-stinking=believable, I just about died. I went uber early for a Seabrook wristband, and while in line I heard about extra passs to the last two autograph sessions (one of which was Tazer and the other of which was either Hossa or Kaner so OBVIOUSLY I had to obtain a pass). I got a blue one for Hossa, and while in hi line I just so casually pondered aloud &quot;I wonder if anyone would sell me a Toews pass?&quot;. Well, it JUST SO HAPPENED that a couple behind me had been given an extra gold pass to Tazer&#039;s session by accident and they were happy to sell it to Tazer&#039;s #1 out-of-state fan and future wifey for the low low price of $20, even though I had offered all of my cash money ($47, in case you were wondering). I proceeded to give huge hugs to both of them and I&#039;m sure they thought I was insane, but I didn&#039;t care. I met Hossa and msot importantly the man I flew all the way from DC to see, and got my jersey signed. It soon will be framed. All was right in the humongous-big universe.

I have pictures with all of these fine specimens.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yea...they were pretty hot!! But Jess is right, it was chilly in the room. GREAT article, Jess! I am so jealous you got close to him. I was trying to get his autograph when he finished the radio panel but once everyone ducked under the ropes and started attacking him, security rushed him away and he never made it down to my end. I&#039;m kicking myself for not thinking of the idea to attack him first! 

I had a great time in Chi-town this year. Making the decision to stay at the Hilton was definitely worth it since I didn&#039;t have to make the trek each morning and night back to my hotel. Plus it allowed me the opportunity to get a guaranteed autograph from a player. I got Patrick Sharp...he is gorgeous!!! I was excited to meet up with Jess on Thursday night for drinks. It was so fun meeting you! I hope you can make it down to Carolina this year for a game!

If you have not been to the Convention, you need to go. It is truly a one-of-a-kind experience and you will have so much fun! I posted the links to my pictures back in the Sweet Chicago post. Feel free to download as many as you want!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A fun read and hilarious photos.  I have to say that even though he is absolutely, positively not at ALL my type, Captain Serious looks ever so much better with the longer, curly locks.  This is a look he MUST keep.

Also, am I imagining things or does everybody just look beyond sweltering?  Like, literally sweltering hot?  Was it a billion degrees in the meeting rooms?  People look sweaty and the players look like they just finished morning skate...]]></description>
