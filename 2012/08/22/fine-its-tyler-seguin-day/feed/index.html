		<description><![CDATA[Somewhere, there exists a hot NHL player who&#039;s into girls who rock the hardest hairdo in all of humanity to pull off.  

Keep lookin&#039; and keep the faith.  By all accounts, you have no problems randomly meeting these guys.  Report back to all of us when you have snagged said NHL&#039;er.  We will want a full, blow-by-blow account.  Oh yes.  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s totally a-okay to want a guy to grow TF up AND admire him for being a walloping hunk of pretty beast at the same time.  I am seeing signs of maturity now that he has a furry creature that depends on him for survival, positive reinforcement and unhealthy doggy treats.  I have always thought he was delicious to look at and lethal on the ice, just maybe too douchey in person.  I hope he gets better at proving me wrong.

And huge applause for Jana for rocking a hairdo that only .0007% of the population can get away with.  Kudos to you for not having a 6-head, or walleyes, or a buttchin, or Spock ears, or a monobrow, or a pumpkinhead, or bloodhound jowels, or....  ;)  Okay I&#039;ll stop.   You get the idea.  HARDEST HAIRDO TO ROCK.  Hands down.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Casey, you&#039;re lucky that he&#039;s ONLY 5 years younger than you! For me, he&#039;s young enough to make me cringe. Honestly, though, I can say about TSegs what I say about JStaal &#038; Tanger, &quot;For THAT man, I would OWN the title, Cougar!!!!&quot; Bahahahahahahaha]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agreed, Deanna! Especially since said hot guy is also an extremely talented athlete who plays at the highest level of his sport! 

Jana, I have to tell you that I am JEALOUS!!! *lol* I wouldn&#039;t have been able to concentrate, either...I&#039;d probably have been drooling like a half-wit.

&quot;No stopping, Daddy&#039;s hungry.&quot; Probably the BEST &#038; cutest comment EVER! The things I could say in reply to that one.....]]></description>
