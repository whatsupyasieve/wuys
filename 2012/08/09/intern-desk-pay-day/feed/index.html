		<description><![CDATA[Jesus, Jeff. Notice how Donald Fehr - representing the entire NHLPA - is in a button down short-sleeved shirt? Not that I approve of this choice Donald, BUT: Jeffy has a thing or two to learn about workplace appropriate dress. See Lundqvist, Henrik.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t think annual leave was in his contract? And I suppose that&#039;s why all the plants are dead, the bins are overflowing, the coffee hasn&#039;t been stocked up and Pants was throwing a tantrum the other day when we ran out of Whatchamacallit bars?

He&#039;s been &quot;taking meetings&quot;. Uh huh. Well he&#039;s not been practising his Windsor knots on his tie, that&#039;s for sure!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Did he pass his background check and pee tests?  Anything suspicious pop up?  Is he going to need one of those gender clarification tests they&#039;ve been talking about at the Olympics?  ;)  Will he work on the weekends?  Can he print TPS reports in landscape, double-sided unsupervised?

These are the questions corporate should be considering.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good lord, he smiles even when he&#039;s doing evil balance board squats.  The last thing I want to do at the gym is anything that implies happiness.

Of course $34.35M would make me smile even if I were shoveling manure.]]></description>
