		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d just like to point out I&#039;ve seen the pictures of Mr Pants and he does, in fact, bear more than a passing resemblance to the Crosminator. My jaw actually dropped.

Anyways, happy belated birthday Mr Crosby. Lord knows what you ask for when you have, in fact, won pretty much everything, but I&#039;m guessing he&#039;d like a normal girl? 

Is it October yet!?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hard to believe he&#039;s only 25 years old.  Still a child, he is.  I feel like I&#039;ve been watching him forever, although not nearly enough over the past two seasons.  I hope he wished for healthy hockey when he blew out his candles on the cake his Dad&#039;s gonna polish off for him.  ;)  A touching, goofy tribute to Sid without being weird - well done, as always!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m completely obsessed/in love/crazy in love with Sidney, so this blog post is in my opinion, BY FAR, the best....and the other posts about him are just as awesome :)
I
&#039;d be far worse than the kid and his father; i would stare at him, then i would fan myself like a fangirl, then i would scream, and finally i would faint.

Meeting my future hubby would give me a heart attack from his pure sexiness.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY SIDNEY PATRICK CROSBY!!!! &#060;3 :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jesus. Sid says &quot;different positions&quot; and my mind goes to ALL THE DIRTY PLACES. How HOT is he in this video?? Happy birthday, kid - congrats on another year of making me feel inadequate compared to your legion of accomplishments. Canada (and Pants!) loves you!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Happy Birthday, Sid!!!! 

I&#039;ll eat all the cake he won&#039;t eat. I&#039;ll take that one for the team. 

And I think he should wear this hat today, instead of one of his millions of baseball caps:
