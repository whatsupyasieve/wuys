		<description><![CDATA[My favourite was the time I googled &quot;Jonathan Toews sweatpants&quot; and found a picture I took of my friend Carol with Dan Bylsma... From your post of course :)

Coincidentally, Tumblr magically gifted me the very photo I had been googling just now out of nowhere: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m57g808ZPo1qc0l0to1_1280.jpg]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Points for finding a convenient excuse to resurrect the shirtless Seguin w/strippers shots from last year.  ;)

The stripper yacht already happened last summer (the context was the Rookie Booze Cruise, there was a submarine called the SS Doggy Style and it involved an escape from Dry Island, but I digress), but I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll make it even bigger, better and crazier this summer.  Cup or not!

A sweep would be amazing, but as much as I adore the Kings I would like to see the Devils win at least one game.  Contests are fun.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The 6th seeded Devils, playing on June 6th, the 6th month of the year and the 6th day of the month.  666 = he devil.  The sign canNOT be clearer.  This is the day for the Devils.  Just one win could change the entire series.  Like this arrticle says, being in a 3-0 deficit is not the end of the world.  Adam Henrique was in the same position when he was with Windsor and WON the series for the championship!!!  I believe in the Devils!!!  TEY CAN DO THIS!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So much screaming in &#039;04.
Right now, I&#039;m screaming at the Red Sox for an entirely different reason.

Those Jersey Shore heads might be the greatest things ever.

&quot;I‚Äôd buy stock in pancakes, donuts, liquor and glitter&quot; YES!

&quot;(SIDE NOTE: If you Google ‚ÄúTyler Seguin dance shirtless,‚Äù the #5 photo result is Chuck &#038; Tyler and #12 is me &#038; Chuck.  You guys search that term and find our site A LOT, pervs.)&quot;
WE&#039;RE INTERNETS FAMOUS!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just read the 15 facts of the Kings.
#14  &quot;The Kings look like mountain men, or candidates for a motorcycle gang. The Devils look like accountants.Give Dustin Penner a musket, a big coat, and a snowstorm and he could look like the Jeremiah Johnson movie character.&quot;

Why do I feel like Chuck had say in this?

If anyone believes in miracles it&#039;s Flyers fans ;) but has much as I dislike the walking cheeto, Go, Kings, Go!]]></description>
