		<description><![CDATA[Warm!  I live in San Francisco, and Seattle before then.  But I have been visiting Portland forever and am always looking for cheap excuses to go back and visit friends there!!!

TBH - if Dough-boy visited Portland, I fear he might put on 50lbs for each day he was there because of the ridiculous eater scene.  Admit it - he would get into so much gastronomic mischief there.  But having said this, Portland also boasts a burgeoning &quot;microgym scene&quot; (if you can call it that) that could potentially keep his fupa in check.  He would still be able to hit the stationary bike, as per usual, except maybe it would be at BikeBar where he could guzzle microbrew AND generate power for the facility at the same time.

Maybe we should page his agent.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My question is, which one of the gloriously wicked doughnuts at Voodoo Doughnut would qualify as the &quot;Doughty Donut&quot;?  http://i48.tinypic.com/2a61q1c.jpg  Call me crazy, but I see a distinct resemblance between their signature voodoo doll donut and Drew himself.  It&#039;s the mouth!  And the little teeth!  Y&#039;gotta admit the two pink boa donuts with the - ahem - frosting blobs in the middle kinda would be perfect for Carts &#038; Richie, yes?

My favorite coach is getting better by the day.  I love how people are freaked out by his attire and his fugly facial tics.  It&#039;s perfect!!!  I haven&#039;t decided if he was dropped on his head too many times as a child or perhaps Asperger&#039;d out eating a ribeye too many at the Ruths Chris down the street from the HP a few years back...  Regardless, he&#039;s awesomely weird and I can&#039;t get enough of him.  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dawn, I love you.  I was eating a cheeseburger in real time when Drew scored and I almost threw it across the bar!  Also, as I grew up in a bed &#038; breakfast, nothing will ever be closer to my heart that a Newhart joke.]]></description>
