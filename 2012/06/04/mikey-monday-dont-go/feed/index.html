		<description><![CDATA[WOW.  That list surprised the crap out of me!  Who knew so many of those Ds are over 30, and who knew that Dan Boyle&#039;s got so many 666s in his contract!  That last tidbit sure explains A LOT.  But I digress...

If your boyfren wants to secure a happy future with even happier endings anywhere in the NHL, he&#039;s gotta quit impersonating DiPietro and keep himself healthy.  It&#039;s never good when people make jokes about how injury and accident-prone you are when you&#039;re barely in the prime of your career.

Also:  Ryan Suter.  (sorry sorry sorry)  He&#039;s remote, at best.  But he exists.

I know how much you love your man, though.  So I&#039;m sending you awesome vibes in the only creepy way I know how.  :)  Maybe he could try wearing skinny red ties?]]></description>
