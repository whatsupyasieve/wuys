		<description><![CDATA[I have been saying FOREVER that as much as I love beards on the right hockey players, the &quot;playoff beard&quot; thing has RUN ITS COURSE.  I&#039;m over it.  I&#039;m more into guys just having beards just because, at anytime.  Movember is lots more interesting to me, and for a good cause.  I think it&#039;s time for these boys to dream up a new playoff superstition tradition.  Like NO FACIAL HAIR, maybe?  That would be too obvious.  But hopefully they could get the creative juices flowing and think of something new and fun.  The beards should be put to sleep during the playoffs.  It&#039;s too much, already.

So happy the Devils pulled this one off.  Like I said, contests are fun.  :)  How about a series?!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is my boy geat or what?!!!!!  Clutch is the most appropriate word to describe in this postseason!  3 of his 4 goals are gwg AND game changers!!!!  I knew he was something special when I first laid eyes on him :)))))))!!!  The power of the â€˜stache!  From that side angle, itâ€™s a no-do for me.  I am certainly not a fan of them and his goatee grew on me so fondly.  But when he smiles, itâ€™s not so bad.

And if he doesnâ€™t get Calder, and Iâ€™m not including the postseason, I will be really upset with the NHL for more than their officiating.  Two be the final 3 finalists and only being 1 point behind a 2-way tie for 1st is amazing.  It is amazing-er because he is a 2008 3rd round draft pick.  You donâ€™t see that!!!  I really do hope he gets it.  He deserves it.  He helped out the Devils when Zajacâ€™s replacement Josefson broke his clavicle.  Those were some pretty big shoes he had to fill and he did it perfectly.

I love him :).  Go Devils!!!  Keep the faith and believe!  I knew yesterday was your day!  All the signs pointed to it!]]></description>
