		<description><![CDATA[Loved all the hockey player awkwardness, but how did no one think to coach the presenters on how to pronounce Evgeni.   It&#039;s not even that difficult of a name.  By far one of the easiest Russian names, and it&#039;s even fairly phonetic.  Just sound it out people! Even worse, most of the presenters are actors.  People who are paid obscene amounts of money to memorize words and then recite them (correctly) on film.

All the ranting aside, and in spite of all the bad jokes and awkwardness, nothing makes me happier than hockey players in suits.  So hooray for the NHL Awards!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As I don&#039;t live in a hockey civilised country, I didn&#039;t get to see it so thanks for the post. Especially Will &quot;Blades of Steel&quot; Arnett. I love him. Almost as much as hockey, the Professor and Mr Blue Blue Eyes.

Just one thing - have all the players gone to work for the Men in Black? Not that I&#039;m not rocking their tres sexy monochrome black and white look or nothing. Agents S and B indeed!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love this. I love you. I love Evgeni Malkin.

Seriously, he has ruined me for all men. No one compares...not even Saint Crosby, who I missed terribly last night, by the way. 

Will Arnett was hilarious. I thought of Chuck when Bergy won and I thought of you when I saw that Stamkos got an overdue haircut.

Is it hockey season yet?]]></description>

I blame the magical wind that followed Gabe and his hair all night long. So pretty... Thank god for HD.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Speak for yourself, Jess. Between Gabe, Lundqvist (F*CK is right), Giroux (unspeakable things, I tell you), Stamkos and BizNasty (you heard me), I&#039;m losing my mind. 

We should host a WUYS convention in Vegas next year. Timed appropriately with the ways. Consider it a convention excursion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the best part of the Henrik moment was the fact that when they did the recap show on NHL Network, they failed to bleep it out AGAIN. Like, guy falls asleep on the swears button once on live TV, okay...but again on the recap? Comeon. 

Also, all the fans and random people photobombing over Barry&#039;s shoulder were entertaining. Super classy, as always.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Next year. It is happening. Again. All throughout the broadcast I randomly kept shouting &quot;CAROL WHY ARE WE NOT THERE?!&quot; (Carol being my friend with whom I went to the 2011 Awards with. In case you haven&#039;t noticed, I will NEVER tire of telling people I went to the Awards. NEVER EVER.)

I could augment my Twitter avatar collection to include a Gabe Landeskog photo-op to match my Jeff Skinner awkward prom picture.

The only thing that kept us sane during the broadcase wa knowing that Toews and Crosby weren&#039;t there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There were so many uncomforatble moments last night.  I just love Adam and how he rocks the three-piee suit.  I&#039;m glad I&#039;m not the only one who noticed he wore this suit before *cough*post-game interviews after he ended the Rangers season *cough* :)  Grey and purple I love and with his dark hair, boy can he rock and work it!  And I just adored how he brought his brother Mike :) who is not bad looking either.  Wonder what his other two brothers look like.  Boy did Mama Henrique have a handful :)]]></description>
