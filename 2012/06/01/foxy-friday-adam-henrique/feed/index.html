		<description><![CDATA[Well - I suppose Intern Jeff Skinner can take solace in the fact that Sean Coutourier will likely never get a FF mention (the Flyers koolaid required for that to happen would be waiting-for-the-spacecraft-hiding-behind-the-HaleBopp-comet strength).

PS - Landeshirtless. Priceless. Also, *flail* that is not a child.

PPS - I guess Intern Jeff Skinner will have to graduate soon. The boys at this year&#039;s draft were born in NINETEEN NINETY-FOUR. Raise your hand if you were jamming out to Ine Kamoze &quot;Here Comes The Hot Stepper&quot; in junior high in 1994 and not, oh I don&#039;t know, being born.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh and I should mention when I found that video of Adam failing on the Devils quiz a few weeks ago, I feel more in love.  The look on his face when he didn&#039;t know what year the Devils began was pure Innocence!!!!!!!  I put that link up on my Tumblr (which is basically an Adam Henrique shrine) right away!  And again with that gif, I don&#039;t know if I want to be Zach because of the way Adam has his arms around him or if I want to be Adam having Zach shake and hig me like that.  :) :) :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[FIIIIII-NAAAAAA-LLLLLLLYYYYYY!!!!!!!!  Oh.my.goodness.  WUYS, I love you even more.  You made my Friday right now.  When I got this email, my heart oddly dropped, but of joy!  I friggin love this kid (or quite obsessed, but that don&#039;t matter!).  Last Friday, after Adam scored the OT winner knokcing out the Rags, I was saying to myself while high-fiving random people in my Henrique jersey at Buffalo Wild Wings, Adam better get Foxy Friday next week, haha!  And alas!  He did!!!!!!!!!!!!  I didn&#039;t even read the article yet.  Just looked at the pictures and went straight to here.  That gif of Zach shaking Adam is just pure love.  Adam is already a legend, with 2 of his 3 goals this post season being game winners advancing the Devils into the next round!

Now I know you guys are rooting for the Kings (I read that somewhere?!), but I just have to say LETâ€™S GO DEVILS!!!!!!!  We are bouncing back to win the cup!!!  History is on our side more ways than one!!!!!  Now, I should really get back to work, but Iâ€™m going to read this article first :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Poor Intern Jeff Skinner! I almost feel sorry for....wait, the AH smiling photo distracted me in the way that a Kris Letang hair toss would!!! :) Chuck, &quot;serious sexy time&quot; is SPOT ON!!! Yummy.

I love hoodies, too. I&#039;m told that they call them &quot;Bunny Hugs&quot; in Alberta, though. If AH showed up at my door calling his attire a &quot;Bunny Hug,&quot; I would simply melt into a puddle at his feet!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ugh, working with Intern Jeff Skinner is going to be so difficult now.  He&#039;s going to be all pouty and grumpy.  We might have to take him to lunch at Chuck E. Cheese to make him feel better.

The photo of AH smiling...swoon. That is some serious sexy time going on right there.

The sweatshirt collage is brilliant.  I love me some hooded sweatshirts.  But not on a first date.  That is automatic grounds for dismissal.  Although if Adam Henrique showed up at my door, I might have to change my mind.]]></description>
