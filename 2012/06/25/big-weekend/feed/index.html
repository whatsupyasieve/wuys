		<description><![CDATA[There I am, reading the story and I get to the bit about other Penguin weddings and I&#039;m like, yeah yeah, then I spot the immortal words regarding

LEPRETTY BECOMING A DADDY!

I was like, what? Then huh then how did I not know about this before then finally started picturing Daddy Lepretty kidding the head of the diapered baby asleep on his (shirtless) chest. Now I feel better.

Even if my ovaries just exploded.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When you said, &quot;Crosby is scared of girls,&quot; I laughed so hard, because that&#039;s so true! (hopefully not when I, eventually and hopefully, meet him someday).
I was devastated at first when Jordan was traded. But then I thought of Marc Staal.
He&#039;s the only Staal that&#039;s NOT in Carolina.
How lonely must he be in NYC?! xD 
That made me laugh and think how Carolina could get Marc as well, if they wanted to. Honestly, I&#039;d love to see that!! :D
But I&#039;m so happy for Jordan and his new wifey!
And I FREAKING LOVE SIDNEY&#039;S AWKWARD, SMALL POCKETS!
I think that makes him even more adorable &#060;3 :3]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Such a bittersweet day as not just a fan of the Pens and Jordan, but also a lover of the whole Staalsy family. Marc is now the black sheep of the family...but he was already Ginger Staal, so he was already halfway there. Great pictures, also. Would die to attend a Pens wedding. Every time I see a picture of Sid attempting to fit those big hands into much too small pockets, I think of Ricky Bobby...&quot;What should I do with my hands?&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am only barely recovered from this Staaaaaalpocalypse news. Perhaps because I only heard about it at 1 a.m. EST on Saturday morning (seriously, walk away from Twitter and the whole WORLD falls apart).

I know it&#039;ll be better - for everyone, and the opportunity to play with his big brother? Awesomesauce. But still...I can&#039;t help but cry a little at the Pens dismantling from the team I&#039;ve known and loved. Sad panda is still sad.]]></description>
