		<description><![CDATA[WHICH ONE&#039;S YOUR DAD?!  :)  Even if he&#039;s not in the picture, I love the shades the guys in the back are wearing.  Amazing photo!

I think Quickie is a shoo-in for the Conn (win or lose).  Brownie was in the running but he&#039;s kinda petered out during the past few games.

I&#039;m not down with renaming the trophy, though.  All of a sudden, everybody wants to rename trophies that have perfectly appropriate names.  Conn Smythe was a jackass but he helped to put the sport on the map.  He already had a division name taken away from him.  Let him keep his freakin&#039; trophy!

I&#039;m still fuming over renaming the Pearson.  Why not just call it the &quot;Terrible&quot; trophy, now?  Perhaps the Messier Leadership Award should be renamed the Sean Avery Visionary Fellowship?  ;)]]></description>
