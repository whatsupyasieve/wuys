		<description><![CDATA[I. Love. Brad. Richards. So much so that I cheered for Tampa when he played for them (which pained me, but not more than he made up for by being so awesome and gorgeous). Excellent choice!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[He&#039;s so beautiful. He&#039;s like a tree. If he were holding a kebab, he would be the most beautiful man I have ever seen with a kebab. He could be an air hostess in the 60s.

Acutally, he could be a pilot in the 60s. I am totally picturing this now. And it&#039;s kinda working for me.

And I love that I have told my Vegas pool story so often, it has become standard reference.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had forgotten about the half a million dollar donation.  Thank you for reminding me of this.  I&#039;ll keep repeating this to myself every time he opens his mouth and flashes those chipmunk veneers at me.  I just can&#039;t get past them.  If he keeps his mouth shut, he&#039;s A-OK.  They know how to build them in the Maritimes.  ;)  Still haven&#039;t decided if the metro is natural or forced...  Feels just a BIT forced to me.  Like he&#039;s trying super hard to convince potential starlet girlfriends that he&#039;s like really not a himbo potato eater from PEI.  As if that&#039;s a bad thing (&#039;cause it&#039;s not!)???  Just a bit forced.  Here&#039;s to hoping he won&#039;t try quite so hard this year.  It&#039;s effortless with the King &#039;cause that&#039;s who the King is.  Not so sure with this one, though...]]></description>
