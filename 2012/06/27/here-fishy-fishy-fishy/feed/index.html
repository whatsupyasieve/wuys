		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Brain-cleansing&quot; is freaking right.  While we shouldn&#039;t be surprised by the &quot;Class&quot; of 2012 (cautionary) tale, you have to admit it kinda casts a taint on all those newbie pubescent faces everybody was hyping out of all proportion.  It was hard enough to look at them before this broke, but now...  Ay carumba.  Talk about hitting a nail on the head.  Somebody get me a breath mint.  Blech.

Thank you for sharing these perfectly goofy photos of Geno, and to slapbetcomish for identifying that thing around his waist.  I love learning something new!  Geno = smiles.  :)]]></description>
