		<description><![CDATA[Wow....I&#039;ve been reading this blog for at least half the season, so I&#039;m not sure how I missed this: but Adam Henrique is extremely attractive. I had no clue.

Thank you so much, as always, for expanding my horizons :)]]></description>

1: &quot;I mean, not like we didnâ€™t follow hockey closely before WUYS but weâ€™ve progressed to a Beautiful-Mind-writing-on-the-window level of crazy.&quot; There are not enough ways for me to express my love for you guys.

2. Mike Richards DAMMIT. I&#039;m already in love with enough hockey players to make my husband want to divorce me. You and your dreamy beard are NOT helping.]]></description>
