		<description><![CDATA[&quot;This epic beard grows out, instead of down, and if the Finals go long he may cross over into that time Joaquin Phoenix went crazy and tried to be a rapper. Like a tractor beam, once you&#039;re hooked by the magnetic pull there&#039;s no sense in fighting. This unstoppable beard will not be contained by the circumference of a hockey helmet. Regardless of who you root for in this series, Penner&#039;s beard deserves a standing ovation.&quot;

Literary perfection, friends.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;He and Mike Richards recently sat behind the netting at a Dodgers game looking like gorillas in the zoo. If you told us they threw out all their Ed Hardy shirts, we&#039;d almost believe you.&quot;  DYING. :)

But c&#039;mon - WHY won&#039;t Parise at least TRY to grow one?!  Unless the whole team made a pact and decided that playoff beards were bogus and they were going to buck the trend entirely (which might not be a bad idea for next year, much as we all love the beards), doesn&#039;t it look lame for their CAPTAIN (who clearly has more than enough hair to complete this assignment in no time at all) not to at least have a patchy one?  As you point out, Brownie wins the captains contest purely because he showed up with SOMETHING on his face.  This Parise no-beard further proves to me that he&#039;s a vain diva who still has a long way to go before he&#039;s anywhere near the calibre of his papa.  But I digress...

Your PD posts are just getting funnier and funnier.  How will you top yourselves next time?!]]></description>
