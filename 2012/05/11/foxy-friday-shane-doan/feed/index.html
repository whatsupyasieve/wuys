		<description><![CDATA[He&#039;s a cowboy for sure but he grew up worshipping the Oilers so you better take that Calgary reference back asap!!!  ;)  He&#039;s still pretty adamant about hating the Flames.  ???  I know, but it&#039;s like a Habs/Nordiques thing.  You can&#039;t like &#039;em both.

I also am happy to see him in these playoffs.  He&#039;s a terrific leader and deserves special props for helming a team that has experienced so much adversity over the years.  I too am rooting for the Kings but I won&#039;t be upset if the Coyotes go to the SCF.

Bonus points for the gif of him laughing in front of a sign that says &quot;DONUTS&quot;.  I loved this part of his post-game, but I only now just noticed that he&#039;s standing in front of the DD sign.  Even better!]]></description>
