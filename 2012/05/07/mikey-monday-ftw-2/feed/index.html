		<description><![CDATA[Despite my hatred for the Caps &#038; my love for all players named Staal, I did feel bad for Joel Ward tonight. Bad break for a guy who seems like one of the good ones. On another note, where&#039;s the love for Brooks Laich? He&#039;s got some amazing blue eyes &#038; a pretty good playoff beard going. Yep, I&#039;m liking him. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I definitely don&#039;t love Ovi.  Heck, even Dawn called for him to get benched or traded this year.  I might if he came to play all the time, but he doesn&#039;t.  I tolerate him mostly for the sake of the rest of the team.  Sure I&#039;m grateful when he scores, but he should be doing a lot more of that and other things, and doing them all season.

The hit is obviously questionable and I&#039;m surprised the NHL didn&#039;t look at it.  If Ovi kept his feet, I&#039;d call it legal - Girardi is crouched a bit, so his head is at shoulder height, but that&#039;s neither here nor there.  Ovi definitely leaves his feet and that should be examined because Lord knows he has done that before.  He&#039;s been suspended 3 times in 3 seasons and fined twice.

I don&#039;t think it helped that right after the game Girardi said, &quot;I think he hit my head a bit there, but I think it was the right call.  My head&#039;s kinda there and he hits it. I think he&#039;s just playing the game hard, but I don&#039;t know.&quot;  Of all the things the Rangers have made a stink about in recent months, this is one where I don&#039;t think Torts should have kept his mouth shut.  Maybe he&#039;s sick of spending his kids&#039; inheritance on fines, but he would definitely have a point here.

Here&#039;s a dissected look from BleacherReport - http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1173801-nhl-playoffs-2012-why-ovechkin-wont-be-suspended-for-his-hit-on-girardi]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know you ladies love Ovi, however, his hit to Girardi on Saturday was horrible. Ovi clearly left his feet and his shoulder made clear contact with Girardi&#039;s head. Ovi should be &quot;Shannaband&quot; for 3 games at least, based on the hits to the head rule that you highlighted in the Gingeroux piece below. Ovi has great skill, but he is a repeat offender when it comes to cheap shots like this one. He is well known for leaving his feet on hits. After seeing his teammates Green and Nicky B struggle with concussions this year, you think he would concentrate on delivering more clean hits. Guess not.]]></description>
