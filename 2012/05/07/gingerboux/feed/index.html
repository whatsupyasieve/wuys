		<description><![CDATA[im another diehard fan, and i totally agree with you, G&#039;s hit is dirty and he deserved a suspension. what shocks me is that its so uncharcteristic of Giroux to make a hit like that. this is whole series seems to have flipped the Flyers around, they dont seem to know what to do at this point. i can only hope that the suspension sparks something in Giroux and if ( and unfortunatly that&#039;s a big IF) the flyers rally and win this next game, G will come in and kick some Devils butt!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Now that the Shanahammer has been swung, I may be one of the only die-hard Flyers fans to say that I agree 100% with the suspension.  Am I still bitter that Shea Weber used his opponents head as a handball against the glass and got diddly?  Heck, yes.  But G needs to find a way to center his chi and channel his very obvious rage in constructive ways...some of which are probably inappropriate to speak of here.
I love my Flyers.  I&#039;d love to see them step it up and win this round.  But the way they&#039;re going about it now, they don&#039;t deserve it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can slowly feel the world righting itself. Whether or not G is suspended (y-e-s in my opinion) I think the Flyers are going down. It&#039;s part of the universe telling us the love for Parise is real, and a passing fad for Claude.

Side note: just had a convo with a co-worker about the hit and *actually* referred to him as &quot;Gingeroux.&quot; This blog is taking over my life (and I love it).]]></description>
