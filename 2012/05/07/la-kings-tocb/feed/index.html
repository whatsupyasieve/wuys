		<description><![CDATA[hahaha... thanks for the correction! took care of it! :0 I call him Nosferatu! ;) But yes, that was HIGH-LARIOUS. Our Canadian friends say the TSN is much better in regards to announcing. I wanted to kick in the TV. I am getting weary of the left handed compliments. :(]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You mean &quot;TCOB&quot; right? ;)

For me, the highlight thus far is how this team is quietly just kicking the s**t out of everybody who was hyped up to win or expected to go very far.  NBC is once again at a loss for what to do because they hardly read up on these guys.  They even confused Jordan Nolan with Sidney Crosby AND Jordan Staal because they were still not even trying to hide their disappointment that it&#039;s not the usual suspects hogging all the attention this far into the playoffs.  I feel redeemed, personally, because I picked the Kings to go this far at beginning of the season.  Everybody laughed at me, of course.  As much as I would have preferred for the Blues to win at least a couple of games in this series, maybe now Coach ChickenLady will be getting the respect he deserves for turning this team around - just like Hitch righted the course for the Blues.

Now they get to hurry up and wait...]]></description>
