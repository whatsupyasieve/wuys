		<description><![CDATA[Riddle:  Why does this make me notice other stuff on their faces that I never noticed before, though?  Interesting!  I never realized Upchuck had such a nice nose before.  Ditto MStall.  Greene&#039;s got nice cheekbones, and I think the beard brings out Yandle&#039;s eyes for some reason...  Maybe over time, as they progress, beards force you to notice other features on a guy&#039;s face?

PS - Please don&#039;t forget Jeff &quot;Fluffy&quot; Carter - you know, that &quot;other newbie&quot; blonde on the Kings.  Normally he grosses me out but the facial hair totally works on him in every imaginable way.  His teeth seem even whiter than usual when he smiles out of his stache and I daresay there&#039;s a more dignified halo to the whole ensemble.  Here&#039;s to hoping most of his female fanbase hates it!]]></description>
