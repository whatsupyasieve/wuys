		<description><![CDATA[I have never been photogenic. However, Richard was able to cteare a natural setting to capture photos that do not look awkward. He came up with great ideas and locations. Unfortunately, the snow did prevent us from going to some of the selected sites.Both Richard and Andrea did a fantastic job setting everything up and helping me pose without feeling too silly. Everything turned out perfectly.I cannot thank you enough.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I mostly love that Giroux is holding an orange Gatorade, with of course a huge G on the label.  If they even allow other Gatorade flavors inside the arena, I would be shocked.  ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Y&#039;all&#039;s comments about Gingeroux&#039;s plaid suit always makes me smile.  I love that he is cocky enough to wear that thing.  And I have to say this, he has beautiful hands!  I hate that you very rarely get to see hockey players&#039; hands.  Okay, maybe that is just me.  A little too much information perhaps.

Congratulations to you Devils fans.  Your postseason is more satisfying than mine: no more Bergy or Giroux.  Sigh.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll only rag Vancouver fans for losing because it&#039;s the Canucks. But no other team - not even the Flyers - deserves a ribbing. Hockey love hurts no matter who you are.

Claude, here&#039;s to the off-season. Hopefully by October you&#039;ve bought some new (non-plaid) suits and Pants and I have gotten over our crushes. Aka, the universe righting itself. Au revoir.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YEAH DEVIL!   WHAT a series.  The Universe (aa Bryzgalov) was exceptional in each game.  He was the one who kept his team in the game at time in my opinion.  I was incredibly nervous facing him because the Devisl were 0-3 on him with 1 goal in the regular season and we manaed to score 3-4 goals on him!!!!  I am very proud t how the Devils ignored the Flyers antics after teh whistles were blown.  That was a major major part in winning his series.  THough not a Flyers fanand thought the annoucners were pro-Flyers with their excuses and rare compliments to the Devils, I thought it was extremely extremely classy of Girouz to come down on the ic to shake hands with the team when he was suspended.  Handshakes are my favorite part because it showsthe amount of repsect players have for each other once the game s over.

Caps or Rangers, BRING IT ON!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My apologies to Pens fans, whose feelings I may have discounted a few weeks ago.  This sucks.

I&#039;m putting all my eggs into the proverbial basket (aka the Caps) now...and hoping I don&#039;t end up having to root for the Yotes or Kings in the end]]></description>
