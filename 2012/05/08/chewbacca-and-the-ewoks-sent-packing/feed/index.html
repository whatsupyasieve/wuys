		<description><![CDATA[Karma is indeed a bitch.  :(  It&#039;s gonna be a long, cruel summer for Smashville.  The players and coaching staff need to look in the mirror long and hard when they&#039;re shaving off their beards.  And management needs a lobotomy and perhaps some sphincter bleach.  No really.

As for the Coyotes, good on them for getting farther than ever before - one howl at a time - and for picking a helluva good time to peak.  Will be a terrific WCF.  Battle of the goalies!]]></description>
