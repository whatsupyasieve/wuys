		<description><![CDATA[I loved when the announcer asked how that hit by Smith was embellishment and what the refs were smoking... LOVE this series (the outcomes, I mean), not so thrilled with the Coyotes...however, just goes to show how that Dustin Brown is NOT human! Love him!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think Smith is starting to snap from the pressure of having to carry the entire blueline and then some.  It&#039;s cumulative - it&#039;s been building since the Chicago series.  All they do in front of him is block shots (a lot).  That&#039;s something, but as every goalie knows it just ain&#039;t enough 100% of the time.  Quickie&#039;s got all sorts of help when he needs it, but Smith has got nada back there.

Right now, I&#039;m wishing the Preds had won just so that the Kings would have more of a contest here.  The Preds/Kings had some sick games this season.  But then again, I think everybody is glad NOT to be facing the mach-playoff version of the Kings!

Dustin Brown will keep ticking and getting his butt kicked until they win the Cup.  He has spent a lifetime of getting ridiculed, laughed at and generally not taken seriously so this is NOTHING for him!!!  :)  Cute hockey players with harelips always finish first, so there!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That made me laugh which inspired the Sutter picture. Last night&#039;s game was OOC! OUT OF CONTROL! I feared for Dustin Brown&#039;s career. They were out for him but he is a TIMEX! Took a licking and kept on ticking! But I honestly thought the Coyotes had more class. that slash from Smith was NOT cool - AT ALL. He is a bowl full of crazy and I love goalies but not that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Nothing says shut your face like a 6‚Äô 4‚Äù manbeast sitting on your lame ass.&quot;  :) :)  :)  PANCAKE BUTT!!!

&quot;He always looks like he just ate something that tasted bad...&quot;  Mike Milbury on Coach Sutter.  For once, I actually agree with Milbury.  Maybe it was his blindingly fuschia tie that oddly complemented his skin tone...

Very happy for Carts.  That hattie was a long time coming.  Yay for the three-way!]]></description>
