		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s nothing quite like the sight of O-Felch tearing into power bars on the bench like it&#039;s his Last Meal on Earth.  Seriously - I felt so bad for all of those guys when OT3 happened.  They were famished and spent.  It&#039;s not like the old days when guys were more prepared for the grind of bonafide OT.  New NHL regular season OT is over before it even gets started.

I hope all the players went to the sauna today and got some major deep tissue work (no happy endings, though!).  I&#039;ll bet the King treated himself to a mani/pedi, too.  A tooth-whitening treatment, perhaps.

Not a fan of Mikey but even I can tell something&#039;s just not quite right there.  He&#039;s playing like a boneheaded shadow of himself.  What&#039;s going on?]]></description>
