		<description><![CDATA[Ah, Jagr...the man who so disliked the gray in his beard because it made him look old that he shaved off the gray spots, only to end up looking like he&#039;s both senile AND old.

And poor Nicky.  My great aunt grows a more prominent beard than Piglet.  But she can&#039;t snipe on a breakaway for shit.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This feature just keeps getting better and bushier with each passing week.  But I am perplexed by a lot of the beards this year as compared to last.  Maybe it&#039;s the impending &quot;Super Moon&quot; (or Mega Moon?).  The beehive beard, for example.  When did this happen and who decided it would be playoff ready?  Then there are the players who last year were pretty much rocking Imaginaries (can we call them that now?) and this year - just 12 months later - they&#039;re freaking WOLFMEN.  ???  It&#039;s very hormonally incorrect/suspicious.

In any event, I think fair&#039;s fair and you should dream up some awesome/hideous prize for the PD commenter who casually pointed out that Jagr&#039;s soulpatch is, in fact, the Stanley Cup.  Talk about hiding in plain sight!  This is almost as earth-shattering as the Elvis tortilla.  The guy has ridiculous hair karma.]]></description>
