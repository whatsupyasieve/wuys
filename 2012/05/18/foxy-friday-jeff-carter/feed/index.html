		<description><![CDATA[I had the distinct privilege(?) of meeting Mr. Carter during his brief stint with the Blue Jackets. He was at one of my favorite college bars with the rest of the team. I, of course, flocked immediately to Rick Nash and asked for a picture. Jeff Carter offered to take it for me. I laughed and told him I wanted him to be in the picture, too. He looked at me, with a completely serious face, and responded, &quot;Oh, I don&#039;t play hockey.&quot;

To this day, I regret not saying, &quot;Oh, I know. You stopped when you got traded to Columbus, you little baby.&quot; Instead, I said, &quot;Yes, you do. You&#039;re Jeff Carter.&quot; His teammates laughed. I could not make this up.

...as much as I hate to admit it, he&#039;s ridiculously good-looking.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with all your bullets but I would also add a special asterisk&#039;d bullet for our Coach Chicken Lady.  Because he&#039;s a chicken.  And he bobs his head when he talks and behind the bench for no reason.  And he flaps his arms/shoulders up and down for no reason and he contorts his tongue when he spots little bits of peanuts and stray sunflower seeds on the Staples floor...  ;)  Bawk!   http://i47.tinypic.com/33c6efk.jpg

THANK YOU for this Foxy Friday, btw.  Long overdue.  And I concur that he doesn&#039;t float my boat but that doesn&#039;t mean he isn&#039;t a ton of fun to watch and laugh at.  I&#039;m happy Tha Lovahs are reunited at last.  Sigh.  Bravo&#039;s missing out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am bandwaggoning the LA Kings SO HARD:

1) They beat the Canucks (which would be enough of a reason right there).

2) They are beating the Coyotes (which, again would be enough of a reason).

3) They are the little underdog that could. Not just that, but they are playing like BOSSES.

4) Mike Richards.

and finally...

5) Ohhhhhhhh Jeff Carted. I would. I so would. Then I would feel deep shame. And then I would again.]]></description>
