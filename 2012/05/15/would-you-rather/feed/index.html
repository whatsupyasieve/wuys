		<description><![CDATA[Late to the party, but!

Giroux -- I like Stalberg but there are Swedes I like even more, and I have a weakness for that French-Canadian accent.
Eberle!  &#060;3_&#060;3
Hmmmmmmmmmmm, I think I have to go with Nealer on this one.  But it&#039;s the closest call out of the lot.
Beard, oh yes.
Tiny child in tiny hockey gear, upside-down = adorable]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hard choices but gotta go:
-Claude
-Sid
-Toews over everything and anyone
-Beard  (any made with some scruff means business)
-kid going in the garbage

I love the blog. I was just thinking a few days ago where&#039;s a hockey blog written by women with the perfect mix of yumminess and serious hockey, and here it is.  Keep up the good work ladies!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[SID! Anytime. Anywhere. Anyhow. Even though the Kentucky derby pics were a little weird and I didn&#039;t quite understand why he was there. Maybe he really likes horseys. That pic of Nealer.  Is that a black ball laying on the floor in the background or a black bag? Because it looks like...um, well...I guess my dirty mind is at work. Hahaha]]></description>
