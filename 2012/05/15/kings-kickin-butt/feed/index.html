		<description><![CDATA[The Penguins and I have decided to &quot;take a break&quot; and see other people, so I&#039;ve started seeing the Kings!  They are my new team and I can tell you I&#039;m quite smitten. Since my (ex) team isn&#039;t playing hockey anymore WHEN THEY SHOULD BE and have no excuse, I had to find a new love and I certainly have. I want to go all the way...to see the Kings lift the cup!!! So until my boyfriends return, I&#039;m a Kings&#039; girl:))]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do bandwagon Kings fans count?? &#039;Cuz then you need to include Jess and I. Good lord this team is awesome - taking down the Canucks and then finishing David Backes (ok, the Blues) in a sweep? Be still, my beating heart.

Talent aside, the pretty. The PRETTY. Richards and Carter and Stoll, oh my! They just said on TV: &quot;Jeff Carter is such a big man to handle.&quot; I&#039;m sorry Chuck, but that will never not be perverted.

Go Kings go!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Helloooo - ???  FIVE.  There are five of us Kings fans, m&#039;kay?  ;)  That&#039;s a lot.  Enough, shall we say.  It means that there will be more Kings for us five.  Let&#039;s put it that way.  Even 90% of the Staples could care less about this team because they&#039;re either more into whether or not they&#039;re on the jumbotron or they think they&#039;re at a Sacramento Kings game.  But whatever!  It&#039;s all good.

I love how Coach Chicken Lady is just cruisin&#039; along with his peanuts, and how oddly compelling and attractive these guys have become over the past 6 weeks.  It&#039;s just bizarro.  The Seinfeld WCF.]]></description>
