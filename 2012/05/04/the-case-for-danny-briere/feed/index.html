		<description><![CDATA[Not wearing orange anymore?  You can say that again:

http://i50.tinypic.com/5bd85h.jpg

Briere&#039;s got a manchild thing going that I can see being weird to a lot of people.  He might be a bit of an acquired taste.  I prefer him with facial hair.  I would like him even more if he did NOT wear orange.

Flyers/Kings SCF.  Can you just imagine?  Wow.  Certainly wouldn&#039;t be a dull moment!!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No, Pants. No. I can see the Giroux thing, even if I don&#039;t agree with it. I could understand a Talbot thing if such a thing existed, because he does have a certain appeal to the ladies from what I&#039;ve seen over the years. But no. Not Briere.

This is making me feel so much better about me developing an attraction and love of Mike Richards over the past few weeks. At least he&#039;s not wearing orange any more.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh snap you know &quot;Biere&quot; means BEER in French, right?!  :) :) :)

Jackpot!!!  He should make a really crappy home-brew, slap an orange label on it and call it &quot;Danny Biere&quot;...  He could even donate all the sales to his charity, comme ça:

		<description><![CDATA[Well I love the Gingeroux and told my daughter today that she had to marry him since her dad/my husband won&#039;t let me have him!  I&#039;m all about the Flyers until they win and then (hopefully) play the Caps.  Then I will most def be cheering for the Caps but on the Flyers end for warm-ups where I can have meaningful eye contact with my future ... Son-in-law!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love Danny Biere and this gets me into SO much trouble in my house. I cried when he brought his kid to the all-star game. And besides him. EVERYONE must be ORANGE for PHILLY. I&#039;ve converted. I&#039;m OUT, I&#039;M LOUD AND I&#039;M PROUD SISTERS. DANNY is a sniper and he&#039;s AWESOME. Sorry Mr. Cherrie. Buffalo&#039;s loss.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[MG, you&#039;re trying to get me killed by Chuck, aren&#039;t you?!  I think the dad thing is adorable and the Flyers have had a few horrible divorces that make me really sad.  Everyone be happy, damn it!!

He&#039;s only tiny compared to the Flyers.  It&#039;s not like he&#039;s St. Louis or Gionta-sized.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Briere is a freaking stud.  He should have won the Conn in 2010 (sorry Tazerites).  The only reason he didn&#039;t score more goals this season is because he sat a chunk of it out with injuries.  But when he&#039;s healthy and determined, he&#039;s lethal.  He reminds me of the type of guys that used to dominate the NHL pre-lockout.  People go on and on about how tiny he is, blah blah blah.  He&#039;s ENORMOUS out there.  Perfect combination of hockey smarts, chops and chutzpah.

He&#039;s absolutely gorgeous.  He&#039;s not orange.  He doesn&#039;t have weird teeth or brillo hair.  His smile is to die for and his sideburns take no prisoners.  He has handled a messy personal life with tremendous aplomb, and rather than feel sorry for himself/feel like a loser because - gasp! - he got DIVORCED (like most hockey players - like it&#039;s the worst thing in the world ever) he has simply taken the bull by the horns and shown his peers how to be The Perfect Single Dad.

I wish he wasn&#039;t a Flyer.  Sorry.  :(  How about a Foxy Friday featuring him?  If you already did one, maybe a playoffs edition update?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is like our entire text message conversation from last night - I love it! Briere&#039;s whispery voice, Giroux porn (shhhhh don&#039;t correct me), Parise without his helmet. I&#039;m going to ignore this &quot;crush on Danny thing&quot; - lalalalalalalalalala.

And yet another reason to love TSN. I&#039;m sorry, but it&#039;s the only thing that Canada has over the US - everything else is cooler from America. But that video of the Briere/Giroux family? Awesome. And HOT DAMN Gingeroux is uber sexy. I could be close to saying I love the Flyers - looks like I&#039;ve fallen under your spell yet again, Pants.]]></description>
