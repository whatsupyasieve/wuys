		<description><![CDATA[I think that would lead to places that would cause me to explode. It&#039;s probably better I don&#039;t have TSN! ;) But a lass, it&#039;s good to know that he is getting love somewhere because with comments like, &quot;Doughty is certainly throwing his weight around.&quot; I might electrocute myself when I kick the TV in!&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When your fearless leader cuts back on the doughnut cream pies (Exhibit A - http://i46.tinypic.com/2we9hzd.jpg) and follows Geno&#039;s hot yoga bootcamp regime (Exhibit B - http://i46.tinypic.com/34qk278.jpg), the Fatty McFatFat jokes aren&#039;t gonna stop anytime soon.  But for real - Pierre McGuire should look who&#039;s talking.  All those guys, for that matter, except for McHugh.  They&#039;re all flabby buffoons.

This series is becoming more interesting by the second.  I just wish the Staples crowd was as excited as they should be.

@Lindsay:  Jarret Stoll&#039;s bearded look is scorching.  Nobody really wants to acknowledge that the Kings are all sorts of fun.  Dustin Brown&#039;s cleft palate is killing me softly, as well.]]></description>
