		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re not far off with the captaincy idea. He could very well wear the C further on in his career.  I bet in a couple of years he gets to wear the A.

Blues are my choice to come out on top of the Western Conference. I think they have a great club, great goaltending, and could go very far.

Plus you have fellow BU Terrier, Kevin Shattenkirk. GO BU! When he played here and would level someone with a hard hit, the crowd would chant &quot;YOU GOT SHAT ON!&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have loved this man since the moment he was drafted.  I am a born and raised, bleed blue til I die, Blues fan.  And as my dad and I sat in Scottrade Center watching this draft in 2008, I turned to him and said &#039;This guy is going to be the next Al MacInnis.&#039;  He has not disappointed at all.

He only gets better.  I&#039;m willing to bet that he is the next captain.  He&#039;s a stellar player.  And of course, he&#039;s absolutely gorgeous!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[His face is wide and round. But it is his excessively rosy cheeks that win me over. I have a weakness. And, truly, he gets many points for his college bromance with Jonathan Toews. That was a bromance for the ages. Seriously, it makes his brolationship with Patrick Kane look like a broquaintance.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with you.  I like the Blues and I want them to do well, but I&#039;m cheering more for the Kings.  I have family in LA and my cousin is a DIE HARD Kings fan.  I don&#039;t think he&#039;d speak to me ever again if I didn&#039;t cheer for the Kings.  They might have been an 8 seed but are definitely not build like an 8th seed.

Is it just me or is TJ Oshie&#039;s face unnaturally wide and round?

Also he looks so much like that kid from &quot;Almost Famous&quot; - Patrick Fugit]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Draft Stamkos is so EXACTLY my little brother, it is seriously freaking me out.

Also - I enjoy this Pietrangelo. As I am finding I am enjoying many of the Blues (even though I don&#039;t want them to win because I am so fully on the bandwagon for the Kings Streak of Amazingness.). I have an UNNATURAL love of TJ Oshie which is going to earn me an unfriending from Lindsay any day now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There was considerable chatter that he should have been nominated - or seriously in the running - for the Norris this year.  So the day might not be too far off.  And you are so right about his being mature beyond his years.  He sounds like a poised, grizzled veteran during scrums.  Such a contrast to crybaby teammates like Oshie.

I&#039;m torn with this series because I like both teams for very different reasons.  I would love to see LA give the finger to everybody this year, but then again if the Blues have to be eliminated at this stage I would hope they could make this one more of a dogfight.  They look congealed with terror out there - really stiff and out of their element.

By the way, the shots of him with Stamkos and DZ are perfection.]]></description>

Regardless of the age, I think the kid is going to be something special.  When he wins the Norris one day, you can say &quot;Chuck was so right.  She&#039;s psychic!&quot;]]></description>
