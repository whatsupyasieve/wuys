		<description><![CDATA[Premiering in the late summer of 1997, South Park took American pop culture by storm with its no-holds-barred examination of social and political issues and its lewd yet unique brand of cartoon humor. Created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, South Park is the lynchpin of cable network Comedy Centralâ€™s original programming lineup. Centered around the lives of several kids in the small Colorado town of South Park (a place prone to odd and paranormal occurrences), the series presents itself in the form of crude animated drawings, yet the concept works, playing home to innumerable well-written shows filled with boundless wit, well-timed one-liners, and an endless array of politically-incorrect humor. Love it or hate it, South Park is a truly original animated series with relentlessly off-the-wall plot twists and comic relief. If you love oddball humor, then this is the show for youâ€¦;

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Lets Go Kings&quot;  &quot;Lets Go Kings&quot; &quot;Lets Go Kings&quot;~CARTMAN.  I would&#039;ve thought the kids from SouthPark would be Avs fans, tho. What was the infamous pancake incident? I would look it up, but I&#039;m too busy bidding on Calico Critters on Ebay. I definitely think Penner&#039;s the front runner for the &quot;Grizzly Adams Best Beard Award&quot;!!!!!!]]></description>
