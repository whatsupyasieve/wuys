		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t like the Caps, but his hair...is just...so...mesmerizing....

But for reals, I&#039;m sincerely sorry for your loss. This is how I felt when the Packers blew up their nearly perfect season in the playoffs, to..that team from New York (barf). Its tough. At least its only like 4 months til next season! :)  Though I understand it might yet be too soon to see the bright side. As my roomie said after the Pens lost:  &quot;Pens in 8? No? (Sigh) Okay...&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It keeps raining on my face. And we haven&#039;t even figured out which of the 10,000 Caps that are RFA&#039;s/UFA&#039;s are actually coming back. And there&#039;s no coach now.

I&#039;m not going to panic, things will be fine. They&#039;ll re-sign Mikey and Carly and MG will have amazing hair all season and everything will be great as soon as the face-rain stops.

Caps in 2013.]]></description>

A+ effort by the Caps this season.  I still don&#039;t like them, but they played well.  But when you&#039;re competing with the mansomeness that is Henrik Lundqvist, you will lose.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Devils fan here so I was rooting for the Caps all the way.  Though NJD and NYR will be epic (got my Game 4 tickets yesterday) I still wish we were facing the Caps,  I need to see Mike in person.  I bought tickets to Dev Caps last year but of course, he got hurt so he wasn&#039;t even in NJ.  As of this season, when I was introduced to Adam Henrique (and all of a sudden Michael del Zotto?!), I slowly was losing my admiration to Mike.  But alas, this picture came across my Tumblr, and behold I fell in love again.  Hel-*******-lo!!!!!!! is what came across my mind when I saw this!!  His post-season hair has been right on the spot!  Really, thank you Mike for gracing us with this picture.]]></description>
