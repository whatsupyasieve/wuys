		<description><![CDATA[Ohhhh, I second the Beau Bennett motion! Blue Eyes, Blond hair, HOT, aaaaaand he plays hockey AND its for the Pens?!?! Jackpot! 
I think we should throw Ryan Spooner and Jared Knight into the mix. Both pretty foxy, both have a good chance at making the B&#039;s this year (well, lockout pending), and both are great with interacting with fans. I think I have a soft spot for Spooner after meeting him last year and him taking the time to sign and take a picture with my little cousin, but even more so after chatting with him the other day (gotta love twitter!) and him telling me how much he likes 50 shades of gray and gives it thumbs up! Haha! 
Also, anytime I hear his name all I want to respond with is &quot;Spooner, I hardly know her!&quot; I know, I know. Hahaha]]></description>

I think you should dress up like a pineapple for your run tomorrow.  Your arms and legs will be totally free and your headpiece will have a convenient chinstrap so it won&#039;t be overly encumbering.  The rest of you will roast like a overstuffed turkey, though...  ???]]></description>

Murray is destined to be the league&#039;s newest heartthrob du jour; for a change, this is somebody who looks approachable and enticing in a dweeby kinda way.  Needs a new name, however.  And it can&#039;t be Jordan, Brendan, Brandon, Tyler, Zak, Zakkk, Alex or Ethan. I&#039;m feeling Sylvester or Frank.

Tom Wilson, on the other hand, is the beeotch who takes no prisoners on the ice or on a date.  Brush up on your jiu-jitsu if he asks you out.  He needs a new name, though.  Too traveling salesman...  

And you just can&#039;t deny Courtnall&#039;s genes and college roots.  It&#039;s good times.  

There.  Everybody else can pick the shaved and dangerous contingent from Sweden and you&#039;ll be good to go.  I would ditch Yakupov, though.  Sorry, but the PIT sexting debacle won&#039;t go away for me.  I think of that every time I see his monobrow.  He shaves/plucks it but it&#039;s still there.]]></description>
