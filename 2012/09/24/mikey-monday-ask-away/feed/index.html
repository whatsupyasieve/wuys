		<description><![CDATA[Pants, I&#039;m wondering, did you ever got a good look at his hand tattoo while you were building the playground?

AND, I&#039;m all for you controlling the universe if it means bringing photos like this to our attention!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I keep trying to write a somewhat intelligible comment about that picture, and how I have complete faith in you to run the universe........ but then I look at that picture and get all dumb in the head and forget what sentences are. 
Thank goodness for Mikey Monday.  Bless you, Pants.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. YES. Wow, I must really be suffering!  My calendar has Sept 23 and 30 as half a space each, and I counted them as two.  Blame it on the fact that Karl Alzner holding two adorable dogs is Mr. September. It clearly interferes with my ability to count.  Fixing now, thanks!!]]></description>
