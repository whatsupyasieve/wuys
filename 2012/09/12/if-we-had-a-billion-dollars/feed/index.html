		<description><![CDATA[Well, the only silver lining to the lockout (assuming there is one) is that there&#039;s a chance (according to the Denver Post blog) that Gabe might actually play for the Lake Erie Monsters. That would make my season tickets an even bigger value!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Look at those balls!

Easy now, I meant the excercise balls. Apparently even gyms in Sweden are furnished by Ikea. And check out Euro-buddy with the handy cam. He knows what&#039;s up.

I think Gabe was in my dream last night, being handsome and articulate and charming. I don&#039;t remember the context, but I think I ran away from him. Ah, just like in real life.

Finally, all these squats should come with a warning. Not just a warning that watching fit hockey players do squats will render you a nonverbal mess, but that squats themselves are not to be undertaken lightly. Thanks to the Nike Training App, I am now on day 2 of having to just let myself fall backwards if I want to sit on the couch/toilet/anywhere. And stairs? Forget about it.

You&#039;ve been warned girls/boys who are secretly googling pictures of Swedish teenage thighs.]]></description>
