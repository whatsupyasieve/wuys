		<description><![CDATA[Well done, Chocolate.  You guys are all doing a fantastic job summarizing everything we all need to know while also conveying your understandable personal frustration and disappointment in all this as hockey fans.  I like the balance.  Please keep it up and also keep finding pictures of pandas and bears to bring it home, too.  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You should send this to them.  Maybe they could agree on something asap.  I find it silly how they would lock out the players when they know how much growth NHL had in the past years.  You said it, if the owners want to stop the outrageous contracts, then don&#039;t offer them!  There you go!  One problem solved.  And for the $3.3 billion that needs to be split, let it go to the teams who really needs it or to the fans for putting us through this.  

I know both sides are at fault here, but I see the owners losing right now because there is no season, which means no money for them while the players are playing in the KHL.  Hmmmm.  Just don&#039;t understand.]]></description>
