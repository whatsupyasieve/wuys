		<description><![CDATA[Ok, if Gingeroux made a video like that I wouldn&#039;t be able to handle it.  It is bad enough that he is growing a beard until the lockout is over AND has tweeted other players to join him. You&#039;re killing me, Claude, I swear!  And I am loving every minute of it!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The first time I watched, I sat and said &quot;no fucking way!&quot;  I, too, thought he had a stunt double.

I just watched it again (yes, I&#039;ve only watched twice...amazing self restraint) and this time I giggled my way through the whole thing.  The creepy trainer and Max&#039;s cameraman friend must both work in the amateur porn industry in their spare time.  This whole thing wasn&#039;t scripted or anything...otherwise Max might have gotten confused by what they expected him to do with three fingers.

The rest of that aside, can we arrange to get Max and Brooks together for a work-out competition?  One-legged squats vs one-fingered pushups.  We could sell tickets for charity.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That is where you and I differ, Jess.

I love me some Max Talbot. I spent this whole video (and time after) sobbing and asking, &quot;Why won&#039;t he come back to Pittsburgh?&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not blushing. Cringing. Unpopular opinion, but I always thought MT was gross. I am a fair-weather Pens fan at best, and as for Philly, it&#039;s all about Gingeroux, so he doesn&#039;t even get jersey points. Is this serious though? It cannot be serious.

&quot;That&#039;s three fingers, I want one!&quot;
