		<description><![CDATA[^^ What she said.

Is genetic testing part of the Captaining process? Because I have a hard time believing he is a human, let alone a human CHILD. I would find it much more likely that he was birthed by some exquisite sea-nymph following some freaky Zeusian union.]]></description>

What&#039;s scary is thinking about how much BETTER he&#039;s gonna get.]]></description>
