		<description><![CDATA[It was so much fun....back-breaking stuff but fun!

I, for one, was not able to contain myself upon hearing my name for the jersey. &#039;Thought I was winning a Nick Backstrom jersey (which would&#039;ve been AWESOME!), but once I saw that Nick was pulling out a jersey with a whole lot more black scribbles, I was done for. A sound that I have never made before came out of my mouth, and Brooks, Mike and Nick all looked at me like I had just come out of a swamp, covered in mulch.

So yeah...tried all day to contain, came out un-contained in the end. :p]]></description>
