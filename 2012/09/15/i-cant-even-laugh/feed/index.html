		<description><![CDATA[The fact that I will not get to see Claude Giroux score amazing goals and look incredibly gorgeous while he does it is causing me to have a spaz attack.  And I thought I was too old for one.  If he and his other goodlooking pals go over to Europe to play, then I might have go there to visit....OFTEN.  Please lockout don&#039;t last long.  We female fans can&#039;t take it.....sigh.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[They can&#039;t afford it!! I live in CANADA and even I know do many people who are all &quot;Oh, was it time for hockey season to start again? Who cares?&quot; or &quot;Really? Yes! That means CBC can show MORE reruns of North Of 60!&quot;* Granted, I live in the hipsteriest, bandwagoniest, riotiest, oh-we-don&#039;t-own-a-TV-iest part of Canada.

My weekend lockout coping strategy:

Part 1: Gym
Part 2: Go to the UBC football game to look at cute butts
Part 3: Get wicked drunk and go dancing at the gay club (Kylie Minogue remixes have clinically-proven anti-depressant properties)
Part 4; put on my Toews jersey, weep, and eat ALL of the &quot;skinny&quot; Pinterest cupcakes.

Repeat as necessary.
