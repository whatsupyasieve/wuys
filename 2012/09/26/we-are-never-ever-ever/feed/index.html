		<description><![CDATA[Physical activity can provide an outlet for your emotions, especially if you&#039;re about to erupt. If you feel your anger escalating, go for a brisk walk or run, or spend some time doing other favorite physical activities. Physical activity stimulates various brain chemicals that can leave you feeling happier and more relaxed than you were before you worked out. ;*;&#039;

		<description><![CDATA[Haha! How&#039;s the wrist holding up? 

On a sadder note: 
You never know, ALL rivalries may end over all this player solidarity... Plus, according to some, Bettman may have been planning this lockout for as long as five years. Who knows if we&#039;ll ever have hockey again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[GAH!!! Oh, Captain, my Captain...and I really HATE that I have to agree with ya&#039;ll about that damn Soul-Sucking Ginger! He&#039;s HAWT AND so freaking talented it&#039;s scary! He&#039;s one of those that you wish you had on your team, but hate because he isn&#039;t. However, there is NO Caps love here (well, except an admiration for Brooks &#038; Holts) and NO Flyer love, either. For me, it&#039;s Pens-Bruins-Hawks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OMG this post (as relating to Crosby/Giroux)-- it is my life. As a fellow Pens fan with slutty tendencies towards the Caps and a secret, shame filled love for a couple Flyers (mainly Giroux and Briere- and kinda, sorta Hartnell so long as he&#039;s off the ice) I feel your pain!

Pens-Hawks-Caps, that&#039;s my poison.]]></description>
