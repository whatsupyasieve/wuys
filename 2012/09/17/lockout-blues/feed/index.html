		<description><![CDATA[Great piece, pantalones. For as much as pro hockey charges (gouges) their fan base for tickets and merchandise, I feel this lockout is a blatant slap in the face. Both sides are pointing the finger, pandering to the fans that it&#039;s the other side&#039;s fault. Ironic how the current lockout and the election year draw their parallels when it comes to this sort of pandering. Too bad the fans (the backbone of pro sports) don&#039;t have a say/vote, other than to not purchase said merchandise.

Until this train wreck is cleaned up, I will be watching college hockey as well as my son and the other mites crash into each other this winter. If the lockout happens to end, I will be debating whether or not to watch pro hockey this season. I am disenchanted with the power and greed that has enveloped and mired this great sport.   

Last but not least - Move Phoenix to Hartford!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First off I have to get this off my chest, this video made me cry buckets.... lots of buckets.

Secondly I&#039;m still reletively a novice to pro hockey.  For the most part I stick to the USHL the developed a love for the sport in general and began to follow various pro teams.  I&#039;m not entirely familiar with the lockout senario yet.  For what I gathered for the article it sounds like the owners squandered money ment to be revenue and now they are asking the players to pony up more for their mistakes?  I&#039;m I correct?  Some fill me in please.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i can&#039;t help but feel that the NHL is like that bad boyfriend, who keeps breaking up with you, and then eventually begs for you back.  You know that you care about him more than he cares about you, and there&#039;s nothing you can do about it.  And he knows that you&#039;re so in love, that you&#039;ll always keep going back for more.

Now is the time to start drinking wine by the bottle, desperately waiting for him to come back.  This is so depressing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your actual photo was approximately my reaction when the lockout became official. I&#039;ve got a college team in my neighboring town, so thankfully I&#039;ll still get live hockey every other week or so, but I really don&#039;t know what I&#039;m going to do with all my free time this winter.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is ridiculous!  On Twitter, Prust made a good point--why can&#039;t they play when the season starts AND continue with negotiations?!  Like, I&#039;m pretty sure they have enough money to live for a few months without getting paid--just a hunch about that.

And listening to Sarah is right!  I want my Devils season tickets now!!!!  This would happen when I finally buy them.  Because Game 2 of the Stanley Cup cost more than my brother&#039;s ECF and STF tickets....

GET YOUR SH!T TOGETHER NHL AND NHLPA!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very well put. As long as there is a lockout I will not be purchasing any merchandise. I will be back when the game is back, I can&#039;t turn my back on it, its part of my reason to keep on breathing. But at least I can protest in some way. Btw, love the actual picture Pants. That&#039;s pretty much be been me too since Saturday night.]]></description>

This is way more appropriate: http://youtu.be/-_qMagfZtv8

&quot;You&#039;ve changed the locks three times...&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m convinced they visited WUYS and fount out our favourite players (obviously choices) and made a video with them. Jess and I debated on the inclusion of a script, makeup and hair styling (Toews wins this one).

Other favourite part? When I viewed this video yesterday there were 300 views. NOW? 98,259. Suck it, Bettman!]]></description>
