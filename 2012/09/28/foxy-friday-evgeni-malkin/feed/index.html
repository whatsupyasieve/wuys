		<description><![CDATA[Howdy! This is kind of off topic but I need some 
advice from an established blog. Is it tough to set up your own blog?
I&#039;m not very techincal but I can figure things out pretty fast.

I&#039;m thinking about setting up my own but I&#039;m not sure where to start.
Do you have any ideas or suggestions?  With thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, I am totally late here because I&#039;m guilty of letting things pile up in my google reader and then reading a bunch of posts in one fell swoop.

Which means I&#039;m late on pointing out that I TOOK THAT PICTURE OF THE THREE GUYS ON THE BENCH! And then a couple weeks ago, I saw a link to this version - someone had cropped and black-and-white-itized it, and it was getting like 500+ reblogs. Still no idea how that happened.

Anyway, it was my favorite game I&#039;ve ever been to, so it makes me smile that the photo has apparently taken on a life of its own and is going forth to spread joy around the internet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m absolutely dying at: The Michael Phelps Dilemma. :) 

I discovered this blog looking at Mike Green pictures a few months ago and now I have it bookmarked and check everyday. 
The captions under the photos are my favourite and also the fact you focus on all the same players that I love! Keep up the amazing work!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is ABOUT TIME! You know how I feel about Geno. He completes me in every way that someone I don&#039;t actually know could complete me.

I must have bizarre taste...because I think he&#039;s the foxiest guy in the league. *hides from objects being thrown*

Side note: He also has a HUGE heart and steals mine with every bit of charity he does.

...and I would swim across the Pacific Ocean if I thought he&#039;d take me to dinner.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[He&#039;s a textbook first-decan Leo, which largely explains why he&#039;s so very different from second-decan Leo Chachi. That, and Russia.

As much as I love poking fun at Russians - because it&#039;s so damned fun - I also celebrate them and to me, Geno is the epitome of everything that is awesome about Russia.  He is one of my pet athletes and I adore that he is his uncensored self 24/7.  There are times when I want to kick him in the derriere but most of the time, he kicks me in the derriere and that&#039;s how I like it.  ;)  

Re hot or not:  It&#039;s a tough call.  There are definitely times when he&#039;s scorching hot and as you pointed out, he also has his butterface moments.  Always nice to look at from the neck down, however.  Even in an ugly sweater.  His sense of humor and candor offsets the butterface most of the time, though.]]></description>
