		<description><![CDATA[Hello,

I am trying to implement a helmet safety campaign at Utah Valley University, and I was wondering if I could use the image. &quot;Taylor Hall should listen to his mom&quot;

Please let me know if I can! 

Thank you,

		<description><![CDATA[HOLY SHIT!  I didn&#039;t see this until he just popped up talking on NHL Network.  That is horrendous!

Meanwhile, this is about the ONLY injury Mike Green hasn&#039;t had and there&#039;s no way he&#039;s wearing a helmet in warmup. Not over that hair.  I mean, if he ever plays.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Once he&#039;s healed, I volunteer to smack him up side the head for not wearing his helmet.
That&#039;s what he gets.
He&#039;s SO lucky that all he got to his eye was a big black eye...]]></description>
