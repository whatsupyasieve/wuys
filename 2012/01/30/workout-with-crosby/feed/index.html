		<description><![CDATA[I really don&#039;t know what this says about me, but my only thought during that commercial was, &quot;Those medball push-ups look hard.&quot; And then, &quot;Must never show this to my coaches.&quot; But finally, &quot;Sid needs more of those clingy white shirts.&quot;
If I wasn&#039;t already tired from practice, I&#039;m beat.
I miss Sid a lot too, but I&#039;m so afraid he&#039;ll come back and then we&#039;ll have a massive repeat of the past year, which I really really don&#039;t want.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On this Crosby commercial, happy to decrease everyone&#039;s productivity since obviously I&#039;m suffering. When I saw the spot last night I practically shouted - in front of my husband, no less: &quot;WHAT IS THIS COMMERCIAL?!&quot;

And zero grudges on the Gingeroux Foxy Friday post from up here in Canada. In fact, Carter can now attest that I&#039;ve fully crossed over to that dark side.

Actual text message from me to Carter this morning: &quot;Dude. Gingeroux is going to be in my city on Feb. 25. WHAT IS LIFE?!&quot; Your brainwashing is complete, Pants.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ok, my healthcare professional hat is on! When it comes to neck injuries, unless they did MRIs of his neck as well as his head (bizarrely, not done at the same time - separate scans) then they won&#039;t have picked it up. And it is also perfectly possible that any cervical injury (whiplash, cracked vertebra, tho more likely whiplash) could have been contributing to the headaches.

Lindsay has done a grand job turning you back away from the Dark Side of the Force ;).

I shall step off my professional soapbox now. I missed the ASG. we are having &quot;issues&quot; with our cable signal right now grrr]]></description>
