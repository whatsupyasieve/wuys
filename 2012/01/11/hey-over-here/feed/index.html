		<description><![CDATA[Oh the Octane... We have ice girls too in Edmonton. But they&#039;re fully clothed. Oiler shirts and pants. I don&#039;t think anyone really pays attention to them.

The Octane are just an abomination. I&#039;ve yet to hear of a single person who finds them worthwhile. No one pays attention to them either.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was actually at this game, and this is no way to explain the elation that erupts inside as you witness a hat trick live! It was my first one, and I&#039;m unlikely to see another, so I&#039;m glad I got to see Stalberg&#039;s first. He is one beautiful Swede! And Captain Derpface is looking extra sexy with those stitches. Although, I do NOT want to see anymore of them, I was panicking for about 8 minutes when he left the bench, and didn&#039;t relax until I saw him walking back up the tunnel to return to action.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not my poor...I mean Toews face!!! Even with the stitches and cuts, he is still HOT!!! I got my Blackhawks Magazine in the mail yesterday from my friend who lives in Chi....hotness on the cover!!! Seriously though, Jonny...STOP messing with perfection...PLEASE???

In other news, The Hurricanes have The Storm Squad. After seeing what the Hawks girls look like, I actually like the Storm Squad. They are covered with the exception of some skin around the midriff. They are WAAAAAAAAY better than what the Charlotte Checkers have...If there could only be a pole for them to entertain on....YIKES!!! I have seen some of the Hawks girls up close at the convention....they are better looking from far away.

I agree that there should not be cheerleaders in hockey. There is no need for them. Period.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Kings have the &quot;Ice Crew&quot; and they wear bikini tops and pants (very odd combo).

		<description><![CDATA[When recounting our trip to the United Center in November the first thing my husband tells people is how hot the ice girls are. Well noted, Pants.

That derp face of Toews is amazing. Happy Turtle is HAPPY! And I&#039;m with Jess - enough, Blackhawks. It&#039;s bad enough that I&#039;m in love with the entire team. This hat trick nonsense is over the top. Slash, keep it comin&#039;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was still on the bus and Twitter exploded with &quot;NOOOOOOO!!!!!

But I should know better than to worry about Captain Invincible. He will live to  But seriously, all of this puck-to-the-face-Edward-Scissorhandsification business needs to stop. I makes me freak out like I&#039;m his mother. Mama Toews must be all &quot;Zhjon-ay-ton! You are ze only handsome son zat ton père and I have! Pleeze protect your beau face, mon petit chou.&quot;

As for the ice girls, Vancouver has hot girls too, but they&#039;re covered head-to-toe in LuLu Lemon. At least the the Hawks ice girls actually scoop ice and hats. Edmonton has the &quot;Octane&quot;. Nominally cheerleaders but their &quot;Bring It On&quot;ness is limited by the fact they are standing on a tiny carpet on the ice. So they just shimmy their boobs. Cheerleaders at hockey? Really? Football? Absolutely. Basketball? Sure. But hockey? Really?
