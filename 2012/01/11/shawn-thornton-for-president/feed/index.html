		<description><![CDATA[Would that be one Mark Stuart, formerly of the Bruins? Who I met and could NOT stand?!

Oh my stars, I find that tres amusing!

Timmeh hugs yay! You know Thorty went right there first!

And my Charlestown-based big brother (and who lives a couple streets away) informs us that, yes, they love Thorty and he loves them!]]></description>
