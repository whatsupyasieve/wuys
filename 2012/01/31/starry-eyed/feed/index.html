		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s no secret. Geno is my life. So, my favorite part (or at least when I screamed the loudest) was during the hardest slapshot competition. When Chara was shooting, Geno was laying seductively on the ice...and I have never wanted to be ice more in my entire life.

Can we please get a Geno Foxy Friday? He is every Pens&#039; fan ultimate fantasy right now. Male and female.

I hope you had a GREAT time, Pants! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nealer and Logan (I don&#039;t know what his nickname is) are lookin&#039; pretty hott in their &quot;prom&quot; pics.  The ASG has helped me to appreciate some of the other hotness that is NHL wide outside of the Pens&#039; universe! Plus these guys are really excellent athletes, too. haha]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[JOEY THE JUNIOR REPORTER! The NHL finally clued into the genius that the Hawks have known for a year: sassy children interviewing NHL players makes women SWOON.

Joey spent time with King Henrik (Joey&#039;s mom thinks he&#039;s &quot;dreamy&quot; - smart woman), commented on Scott Hartnell&#039;s hair (he&#039;s a fan) and for a brief moment made us love the Sedins (what is life?!).

Side note - I used to live in Ottawa and the shots of Joey in a Blue Line taxi and eating a Beavertail?? ZOMG.

Here&#039;s the full scoop:

		<description><![CDATA[There was so much potential Foxy Friday at the ASG, it was bananas!  Going to be hard to make a selection this week, and I think it&#039;s my turn.

We featured Captain Serious waaaaay back when (and really isn&#039;t every Toews post foxy?) - http://whatsupyasieve.com/2010/10/08/foxy-friday-jonathan-toews/]]></description>
