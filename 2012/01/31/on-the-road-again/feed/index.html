		<description><![CDATA[Correct! Sharp visited a library and sent women&#039;s hormones into a frenzy everywhere by reading to children. I actually teared up when he talked about his new baby. Ridiculous.

If you haven&#039;t already watched this video it&#039;s a must-see: http://video.blackhawks.nhl.com/videocenter/console?catid=894&#038;id=151833

And YAY for Tazer&#039;s return! Fingers crossed Jessica will survive it - she&#039;s going to the game in Vancouver. In her Toews jersey. Brave woman.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Patrick Sharp!  Are you reading The Magic Hockey Stick children&#039;s book?  That&#039;s an awesome kid&#039;s book about a girl whose parent&#039;s accidently purchase Gretzky&#039;s hockey stick at an auction.  She uses the magic stick and becomes a scoring hero, but during the same time, Gretzky falls into a slump.  As much as she loves having the stick, she returns it to the Great One.

Thanks for the pics!  Love those Hawks!]]></description>
