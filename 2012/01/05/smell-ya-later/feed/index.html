		<description><![CDATA[I am NOT LOOKING FORWARD to this matchup. The Flyers (in my opinion) are one of the dirtiest teams in the league and I&#039;m terrified of them beating up on my pretty Hawks.

The Hawks have a video with players recapping their Philly memories, and clearly Jonathan Toews has been taking hair styling lessons from Patrick Sharp. He also says &quot;iTunes&quot; like a senior citizen, as he has much to learn about technology.
