		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t believe Bourque has been acting the way he has. I watched him play in the minors and he was never a dirty player like he is turning out to be. He was an offensive threat and even won the AHL rookie of the year award the year he played in Norfolk. I remember one game, he skated back to the bench and there was this thing hanging from his face...turned out to be half his chin that was sliced open and was hanging around waiting to be stitched up!

In totally unrelated news, Intern Jeff Skinner has been enjoying his &quot;time off&quot;. He was up in the press box during the Canes game on Tuesday having the best time watching the game and laughing his cute little ass off with the other boys who were up there as well. I thoroughly enjoyed watching Jeff have such a good time!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I go back and forth on Carcillo. I mean, I think he&#039;s here to fill our need for a physical forward, and yes, he&#039;s done that, but not in the way I wanted him to. If it were possible to clone Jamal Mayers, I would totally do it. He throws hits and he fights every game, but they&#039;re clean hits (I can&#039;t remember any suspensions this year) and his fights always have a purpose. (Or if they don&#039;t have a purpose, they&#039;re well disguised because the team usually seems to have more heart afterwards.)]]></description>
