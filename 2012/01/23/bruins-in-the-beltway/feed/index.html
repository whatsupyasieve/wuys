		<description><![CDATA[I think it was rude and a bit childish that Thomas didn&#039;t attend. Whether or not you agree with Obama&#039;s politics or with the administration, he is the leader of this country and it&#039;s an honor to be invited to the White House. When Obama spoke at U of M&#039;s graduation a few years ago there were plenty of people on this campus who HATED him that still chose to attend because he is the President and they respected that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think Tim Thomas was rude.  We have a nitwit as Prime Minister in Canada, but I bet you dollars to donuts the guys would go.  Why?  It&#039;s an honour and hockey needs all the positive PR it can get.

Too bad Zedno Chara can&#039;t give a lesson to Mr. Thomas on what life was like without a democracy.  He must have family members with stories about life under Soviet rule.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While he was well within his right not to go, I firmly believe you should have.  Even if he is a staunch conservative, you first and foremost respect the office, even if you don&#039;t respect the man.  At the very least, he should&#039;ve gone to support his team!]]></description>
