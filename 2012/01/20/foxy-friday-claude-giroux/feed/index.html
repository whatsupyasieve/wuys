		<description><![CDATA[I am guilty of creating the caption on the G/King Henrik pic. I posted it to my tumblr and it blew up! Thank you for finally making him a Foxy Friday. I think blogging him should give him that good luck push he needs to get out of this scoring slump.
Pants, I know how tough it is to post a Flyer for Foxy Friday so those of us who bleed orange and black appreciate it.

P.S. I went to practice today and much to the chagrin of the Ginger Jesus&#039; (or Cheesus) fans, he definitely got a hair cut.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What Chuck said.

Also, I fully anticipate fresh new fangirling from my friend Diana who reads this blog, but refuses to have any Internet presence despite her hilarious hilarity. She rivals Pants&#039; love for those with a tinge of the ginge, I assure you.

And really Lindsay? Giroux? We&#039;ll talk about this later...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hate you.

I hate you for posting these photos and making me think for a fraction of a second that Gingeroux is attractive...even with the hair and the missing tooth.  But the whole ginger/French-Canadian thing has been confused.  I feel like he should be Irish and a former member of Westlife rather than a hockey player.

I will admit that he is pretty bad ass.  I would very much like him to be on my team.  He&#039;s boss.

It&#039;s true what she says about the gingers. Pants luuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrves her some gingers.  She always wanted to marry a ginger so she could have ginger kids with curly hair.  Sadly, Mr. Pants is not a ginger.

BTW - excellent Jon Farr reference!]]></description>
