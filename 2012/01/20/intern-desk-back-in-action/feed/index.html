		<description><![CDATA[Jeffy, you&#039;re such a dreamboat! But enough about you - let&#039;s talk about the NHL Tonight commercial. Just further evidence the NHL is out to kill us all by rounding up the league&#039;s hotties into one snappy 30-second commercial. (With the one mistake inclusion being Ovechkin, of course.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[JEFFY!  We&#039;ve missed you!  It&#039;s been so sad around the offices without your boyish charm and smiling face.  Also, our water cooler is empty.  I&#039;m thirsty. Would ya mind taking care of that?  Great.  You&#039;re a peach.

Really, James Neal?  WTF is up with your hair? You don&#039;t make it like that on purpose...do you?]]></description>
