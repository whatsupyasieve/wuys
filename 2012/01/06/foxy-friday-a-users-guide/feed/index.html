		<description><![CDATA[... Oh wow.  Those are both LOVELY.  Thank you for the links!

I don&#039;t know why I like the mountain man beard, either.  Possibly because it makes him look older and I can feel a tiny bit less like a hypothetical cradle robber.

I think it&#039;s just that I really like beards, though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with AB that Ryan O&#039;Reilly would be an excellent choice (he and linemate Landeskog are pretty much why the Avs aren&#039;t a complete disaster this season, especially with Duchene injured), but I actually prefer him with the full beard.  But I&#039;ve always been kinda partial to a well-executed viking-esque or lumberjackian sort of look.  Also, he&#039;s definitely grown into his looks -- he&#039;s only 20, and a lot of the pictures from when he was younger... well, let&#039;s just say he&#039;s much, much hotter now, and I think the beard emphasizes that.

two articles about why he&#039;s awesome:
http://www.denverpost.com/avalanche/ci_19677503
http://bleacherreport.com/articles/969395-colorado-avalanche-ryan-oreilly-emerging-as-the-avalanche-team-leader

a couple of interviews:
http://video.avalanche.nhl.com/videocenter/console?id=124762 [a post-game interview with a good view of the full beard, longish hair (though sweaty), and missing tooth]
http://video.avalanche.nhl.com/videocenter/console?id=88882 [&quot;In His Own Words&quot; interview from Dec 2010; if you can resist his smile as he&#039;s talking about his brother Cal (who currently plays for the Phoenix Coyotes) toward the end there... well, I&#039;d be surprised, is all]

a few pictures:
http://avalanche.nhl.com/club/gallery.htm?id=24156 [gallery of him playing recess games with elementary school kids; I like #4, #9, #11, #12, and #16 the most -- he just looks like he&#039;s having so much fun!]
http://alesiaaa.tumblr.com/post/10910068767 [his hair looks especially good in this one, all soft and wavy and touchable; also, his smile is adorable]
http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/5208/ryan-oreilly [the picture they use is an unusually good version of his less-bearded look]

... Annnnnnnnnd now that I&#039;ve gone on far too long, I&#039;ll go back to lurking.  /o]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Watch this video of Varly and you&#039;ll see that he&#039;s a cutie and could be a very good Foxy Friday with his dimples.  He&#039;s also on the Avs so that would give you some variety.  Ryan O&#039;Reilly would be another good choice as well (when he&#039;s shaved, otherwise he looks like a mountain man with his beard).

I agree that Lundqvist needs to be featured.  Just his clothes alone are worth a post!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ok, somehow I missed this really stupid list in the Calgary Herald.  I&#039;m sorry, but I would never put Toews in second place.  In fact, I wouldn&#039;t put him on this list at all.  I know he&#039;s popular around here but I think he looks creepy and gross.  That said, I&#039;m confident that WUYS could put together a top 30 list that didn&#039;t suck as bad as this one.

Also, I second Kitkat.  No Lundqvist on the Calgary list OR Foxy Friday?  WTF everyone?  He has PERFECT HAIR and LASER BEAM EYES.]]></description>
