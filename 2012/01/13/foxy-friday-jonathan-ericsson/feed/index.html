		<description><![CDATA[Gorgeous! I can&#039;t disagree with your Foxy Friday picks 99% of the time! haha  I can see the Tanger resemblance in the second pic with his hat on backwards, but not so much in the other ones.  Doesn&#039;t matter &#039;cause he&#039;s pretty all on his own:P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not that we don&#039;t love the Red Wings...we just don&#039;t follow them.
Our only connection to the Wings is our friend Dan, aka the Flop, who wore a Red Wings jersey all the time in college.

We was our very own Cameron (from Ferris Bueller).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m disappointed in myself that I&#039;m just learning of this Foxy Friday.
Seriously, there must be something in the water in Sweden when you look at the sexy: Stalberg, Lundqvist, Backstrom, Ericsson.
