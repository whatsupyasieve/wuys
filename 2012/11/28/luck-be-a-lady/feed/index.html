		<description><![CDATA[Oddly, I posted to my FB page this morning that I love day dreaming about what I&#039;d do if I won this kind if money--keeping in mind I don&#039;t play. One of my friends asked, &quot;I assume you&#039;ll be buying a particular Swiss team.&quot; 

My friends know me too well. 

Or I post a lot about Tyler Seguin. 

Either way, I told her I wouldn&#039;t buy the team but would definitely be taking a trip to Switzerland to see him play. I mean, I&#039;ve always wanted to go there anyway. Now I have a great excuse.
