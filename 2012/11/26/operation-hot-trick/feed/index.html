		<description><![CDATA[As an attendee of said charity game (albeit one without any awesome pictures, boo!), I must say that all these boys were looking 10 kinds of good. 

Also, if they DO do another game in NYC, I am SO. DOWN. Do it, players. Do it for the children/us.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[God bless you kirstenfrances! Nealer has dialed the hotness factor waaaay up in this lingering lockout hell. I&#039;m so happy to see recent pics of him.  King Henrik, well, that goes without saying. I guess I even have to kinda be nice to Hartnell, too. He did a nice thing for charity and for female hockey fans everywhere!  He is still the enemy, though...but not now. Very kind and civic minded to organize this]]></description>
