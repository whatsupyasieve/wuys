		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m doing my best to keep myself distracted from ALL talks of the lockout. If they discuss it at all the TV goes on mute so I can just see shots of Crosby attending negotiations. If they mention things like &quot;there might not be a season...&quot; I just plug my ears and go &quot;LALALALALALA&quot;

Distracting myself has been the best because really, I don&#039;t think I could handle the heartbreak. I love all our talk about the foxiness of said players but when it really comes down to it, not seeing the game is just so depressing. Booo.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe it&#039;s naivety or delusion or stupidity. Maybe it&#039;s because I&#039;m an eternal optimist. But I&#039;m holding on to a very thin shred of hope that the NHL and PA will come to agreement. We may not have hockey come December 1st. It may be January 1st. But it&#039;ll happen.

I hope.

I miss hockey and everything that comes with it.]]></description>
