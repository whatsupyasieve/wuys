		<description><![CDATA[GODDAMN IT JESSICA! It&#039;s ONLY because Pants and Chuck are democratic (I like the authoritarian regime better where Toews/Bergeron/Backstrom/Seguin/Nash are the only players profiled - screw democracy) that I will concede...a little. Pants managed to dig up the prettiest pictures of Hall available - but mark my words: as soon as November is over and Eberle shaves, it&#039;s back to Ebs &#062;&#062;&#062;&#062;&#062;&#062;&#062;&#062;&#062; Hall.

More importantly, as soon as the lockout is over I can forget all about this two and get back to admiring the real hotties.

Also: &quot;I find it hard to believe the fangirls canâ€™t run faster than he can pedal.&quot; Disagree - have you seen their thighs??]]></description>
