		<description><![CDATA[Yeah but aren&#039;t the Staals wearing the knee socks?  Maybe I suck but I swear they&#039;re wearing the knee socks.  Without the garters...

Push comes to shove, these guys are WAYYYY too uptight to be seen in their undies.  My strategy works much better:  2 sips of sake and they&#039;re 3 sheets.  Then put a bag over their head(s) and do your business!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The end of that first sentence should have read; &quot;Especially if it&#039;s Sidney Crosby, Mike Green, Jonathan Toews or Claude Giroux.&quot;

And the order of those Staals, left to right (without the video OR enlarging mwah ha) is:

Eric, Marc, Jordan. :)

Love ya.  Pls keep it up!]]></description>
