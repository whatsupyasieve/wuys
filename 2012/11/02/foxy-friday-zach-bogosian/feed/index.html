		<description><![CDATA[West Is Best.  ;)  I challenge WUYS to post only Foxy Fridays featuring players from Western Conference teams (or players from teams located west of Ontario) throughout Movember. DM with candidates to follow.

Think of this lockout as an opportunity to explore some different horizons.  ;)  Try something different.  The forays into the Rockies (read:  Colorado) are encouraging, however methinks if a certain newly-appointed Captain Swedish Teenager weren&#039;t on said team, the Avs might be left out in the cold as well.]]></description>
