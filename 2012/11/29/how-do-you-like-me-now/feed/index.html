		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s called creative license and yes you&#039;re also allowed to dream and even LIVE the dream if you want.  I feel like I&#039;ve read this before (like you wrote it before!) or maybe I&#039;ve been expecting it from you for so long that it seems like deja vu at this point.  Either way, it&#039;s a fun read and I encourage you to indulge in more of the same!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This was hilarious. And full of feels. I read it with a big goofy grin on my face-the kind that sappily cute rom-coms usually inspire in me. I&#039;m now requesting that Stamkos be added to the equation!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I LOVE this! I actually thought the frosted tips were kinda sexy. Its just a fact, though, as soon as a player puts on that Penguins jersey they become hot, hotter and hottest. I do love me some Nealer for sure:D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can only dream that the guys from my high school have grown up this well. The guys just aren&#039;t aging well. It&#039;s the girls who have gotten better with age. Myself included, of course. ;)

But here&#039;s what I like about James Neal: He seems like a dork--who happens to be a really good athlete. And that&#039;s a great combination in my book.]]></description>

&quot;Pants is a wonderful writer.&quot;

You really should get in on the YA racket. This piece gave me all sorts of feels. Not hockey feels. LIFE feels. I&#039;m actually a little emotional (because I, at 30, am the target demo for YA). You have The Gift.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Perhaps a series of James Neal fan fics? EVEN BETTER! Make them &quot;choose your own adventure.&quot; &#039;Turn to page 9 if you get so nervous that you drop your books and hide, or turn to page 24 if you fall helplessly into his dreamy eyes.&quot;

Literary gold, I tell you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My friend played hockey with JN18 when they were little. Now my friend is a police officer in Whitby and I make him tell me every time he sees Nealer out and about.. which is apparently a lot now that he&#039;s still at home due to the lockout.

EVERYONE ROADTRIP TO WHITBY AND WE CAN MAKE THIS POST A REALITY.]]></description>
