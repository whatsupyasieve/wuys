		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t get it. That gif of RNH is unusually hot. I&#039;m going to blame the camera angle and that hot, manly watch. 

Jess and I agreed that Hallsy&#039;s mo makes him look a little like an old time-y actor. I tweeted him that, but no bite. It&#039;s a matter of time until he responds to my harassment-- I mean, charm. :]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[$6.99?!?!?

I know it&#039;s the minor leagues, but I paid $35 when OKC came to play the Abbotsford Heat. AND I had to sit in traffic for 2 hours to get there.

Even the junior games are $27. I&#039;m going to another Vancouver Giants game on Saturday. I&#039;ll let you know if anything awesome happens. It&#039;s Trevor Linden day. I know he was a worthy honouree, of my suggestion, but he is EVERYWHERE AT ALL TIMES in Vancouver. I&#039;m really getting sick of his face.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is what Pants does to my unconscious.
Also Amanda with her tumblr finds. 

It&#039;s not fair.  I&#039;m in a very fragile state with the lockout and they prey upon me like feral cats on a little teeny mouse.

My resolve can only crumble.]]></description>

He was a great boyfriend.

We were at the beach.

We frolicked in the waves.

He gave good hugs.
