		<description><![CDATA[Completely agree. 

Btw, Chuck and Pants, I totally think that if he does the alumni game in MI again next August, you two are coming to Indy and we&#039;re roadtripping up there. Plus, if James Neal is there again, well, I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll take much to convince Pants.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Everything. Just ... Everything. 

I&#039;m so happy WUYS was able to put this photo into words because I flipped out when I saw it and it took everything I had not to blow WUYS with DMs on Twitter when this photo was posted. Having seen up close and personal just how hot he is in person a few months ago, I just didn&#039;t think it was possible for him to get hotter. 

Yes to the hair. Yes to the beard. Yes to more scarves.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Be still my heart. He was here filming Man of Steel for months and my rabid creepy pervert sense never once kicked in. Have you seen the commercials for Dunhill Black and Dunhill London?? YOU TUBE THEM IMMEDIATELY.

I do see where you were going with this though. But please, Tyler could never be Lord Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk (Seasons 1 and 2 only). And Henry Cavill could never be... Tyler.]]></description>
