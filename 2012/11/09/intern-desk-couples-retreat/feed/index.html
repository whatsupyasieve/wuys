		<description><![CDATA[Jess, Sadly, I watched the MMVAs too to see if they&#039;d give any air time to the hockey boys who were attending--namely Seguin, of course. But nada. Not a single minute. To that, I said, Canada, I am disappointed. 

I&#039;m going to give you a follow on Twitter. I went to an AHL game this past Friday night between the Icehogs v Griffins. As a Blackhawks fan, it was fun to see some of the guys play. Sadly, no Shaw since he&#039;s serving a 6-game suspension. But I do love Bollig. He&#039;s pretty hot in person! So is Pirri. I&#039;ll post a couple pics from Friday&#039;s game.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I watched the MMVAS because I knew they were there but they got ZERO screen time. They couldn&#039;t have presented &quot;Best Canadian Group&quot; or something? I was so disappointed. We had made an event out of it and everything! There was a casserole. And all I got was traumatised by LMFAO and had to learn that there is a thing called a &quot;Cody Simpson&quot;.

I am a little bit jealous of this. But only in the &quot;someone is dating a hockey player and it&#039;s not me&quot; sense (or in the &quot;someone is dating and it&#039;s not me&quot; sense, really). But it is pretty adorable and I will allow it because they totally have the Gomez-Bieber forever-child thing going. And she has career in her own right and isn&#039;t, oh, I dunno, a LINGERIE FOOTBALL PLAYER. (Yeah - waiting for that story to go away. A certain adorable French Canadienne tiger mother is not doing her job.)/rant]]></description>
