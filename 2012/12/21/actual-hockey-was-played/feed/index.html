		<description><![CDATA[I think I&#039;m going to make an MDZ photoset on Diptic. Or two or three. I think I might have almost as many pictures of him as I do of Neal. I have a great one of his running his hand through his hair. I&#039;ll send it to you.]]></description>

I hope everyone gets the chance to attend an NHLPA charity game sometime soon! Or an actual NHL game, that would be acceptable, too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your pictures are lovely and thanks so much for sharing! I watched online for a bit since I&#039;m crazy jealous none of these have been put on in Boston yet. Get on this one, boys!

And I also employ the &#039;speed walk as fast as humanly possible&#039; approach to being in the same space as hockey players! I&#039;ve found that actively ignoring them works, too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[MDZ. YES. Now I have to go back and re-visit his Foxy Friday post to relive it. Especially his sexy scar.

I&#039;m giggling at those Leafs children. Poor, poor fans - will they ever learn?? And I&#039;m with you on Steckel. Like I said before, you should have tossed an elbow - there isn&#039;t a judge in Canada that would convict you in defense of Sid.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was there too...was able to get my son&#039;s PK Subban jersey signed (poor kid was at home with the flu)...and then in a fit of insanity I gave my 10 year old daughter my picture of Joffrey Lupul in his KHL Avtomobilist Yekaterinburg jersey and the sharpie and sent her down to the tunnel...and didn&#039;t she get it signed.  God that kid is gonna score big at Christmas this year.

Great to finally see these guys back on the ice and at Maple Leaf Gardens. I miss hockey.]]></description>
