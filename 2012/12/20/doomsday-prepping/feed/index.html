		<description><![CDATA[I found your blog about a year ago and was instantly hooked. Your posts are always witty and bring many a smile to my face during the dreary work day. My favorite post is still the Lundqvist Foxy Friday. Despite our differences in our favorite teams (I&#039;ll be a true blue Rangers fan till I die), you have taught me to appreciate players on teams I normally should hate, ie Letang, Green, Seguin, Nealmobile and most especially Gingeroux (I should hate all Flyers with the fire of 10,000 suns!) Thanks for the laughs and those gratuitous workout pictures ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I may have only just found your blog over the summer, but I have enjoyed every Mikey Monday, Foxy Friday and every post in between since! And I loved being able to share my encounter with Tyler Seguin with you guys and the WUYS family. Because let&#039;s face it, not many people understand our healthy obsession with hockey and the men who play it!]]></description>
