		<description><![CDATA[Look Intern Jeff Skinner - I know I promised I&#039;d visit on Canadian Thanksgiving. And then again on US Thanksgiving, but I&#039;m really busy here.  What with the season not on, I&#039;m having to work at my other job, which is repairing sick people. And those with sports injuries. Like Jordan. 

I&#039;ll try again for Christmas, if I&#039;m not playing with surgeons and a glorified meccano set trying to figure out which bit goes where, &#039;k?

Note to all - that&#039;s what I really do!]]></description>
