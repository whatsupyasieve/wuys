		<description><![CDATA[Obviously, Sidney Crosby thinks that Gary Bettman is a friggin&#039; liar and needs to go.  Crosby was under the impression that things were close and then Bettman got up and blind sided the players.  THAT is what he is saying.  I would add that Bettman cannot be acting alone here.  There are owners behind this, too, probably starting with Jeremy Jacobs.  This tells me what I have thought from the start -- the owners never intended to sign a deal.  Any deal.  They always intended to let things get at least this far, in an attempt to destroy the union.  They are also destroying all trust.  Bettman needs to send out resumes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just love that even though this video is shot from the shoulders up, you can tell Sid has his hands awkwardly in his jeans pockets. 

I miss hockey. I wish the NHL and the NHLPA would put their egos aside (I&#039;m looking specifically at you Bettman and Fehr), get their shit together and figure it out. Seriously.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[He&#039;s soooo classy even if he is practically jailbait for me.

I heard he&#039;s thinking about Europe for a bit. I promise I&#039;ll a) keep an eye on him, b) keep the cougars/pucks off of him, c) look after him and d) send him back in one piece.  Oh, ok, mostly one piece. Can&#039;t promise everything!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a Flyers fan, I am not allowed to like him but he is rather goodlooking. During this dark time, I thought one thing that could ease my pain would be to gaze upon pictures of the Gingeroux with his gorgeous flow. Nope.  I viewed a recent picture of him on tumblr with what appears to be very short hair. Thanks a bunch, Claude.  I nearly fainted for the wrong reason. Sigh....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agreed.  

(Well, part of it is at work, I can&#039;t listen with the sound on, so I have to just look, but I probably would have to watch multiple times in order to concentrate on what he&#039;s actually saying.)]]></description>
