It looks TERRIBLE!!! It doesn&#039;t look like him AT ALL. 

Grow it back forthwith Gingeroux or consider yourself in deep trouble!

He has to go to Canada to get them. And some Crystal Light? Well, there&#039;s still a lockout and I can always loan him to some European teams, but jus&#039; for a minnit. Jus&#039; a minnit.]]></description>
