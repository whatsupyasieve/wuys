		<description><![CDATA[K, it&#039;s taken me a day to come to terms in commenting on this. I was avoiding it as a life protest (thank you, Jess).

I hope Tazer is sequestered in a dark room with no TV, computer or Internet in an attempt to heal his broken brain. Otherwise Jess and I talking each other off the ledge would have been wasted efforts.

Get better soon, Jon. And as someone who recently recovered from a concussion, if you need to hang out in a dark room and talk about your symptoms, I&#039;m your girl. Clothes options, of course.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hate it when any of my hockey boys has a concussion but I really hate it when they try and hide it. Don&#039;t they realize it takes longer to heal?  Tazer needs to get better so he can read to my grandchildren someday (after he meets my daughter and falls head over heels for her that is)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was at the Hawks/Kings and Hawks/Ducks game over the weekend. Very depressed that Tazer wasn&#039;t there, but glad he didn&#039;t fly with the symptoms he&#039;s been having. The only thing that got me through the two loss weekend was beer and Seabrook&#039;s glorious hair.]]></description>
