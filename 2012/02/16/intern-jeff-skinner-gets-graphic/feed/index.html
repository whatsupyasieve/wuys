		<description><![CDATA[I need a big shipment here in Raleigh so I can sell them in the parking lot after the Canes games...I think Jeff needs to wear one when he gives intermission interviews too...it wouldn&#039;t hurt him either to give a shout out to WUYS during these things either...yeesh!

In other news, you may not be able to contain him now at the WUYS offices...Jeff was just awarded the Triangle Sportsperson of the year in a ceremony at the RBC Center tonight. He might ask for a raise now or some more time off!]]></description>
