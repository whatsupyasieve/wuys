		<description><![CDATA[Atlantic division is strong this year.
Southeast division...eh not so much.

NYR are steamrolling and as much as I hate to admit it - they look real good.  Strong goaltending, good defense.  All key components of making a run for the SC.  Just ask the Bruins.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really don&#039;t understand what happened to the Caps at all. This team started 7-0 with all the same players. Granted Mike Green was out for forever and a day and poor Nicky is still out, but should that warrant where they are now?

The Carolina game was ridiculous. There is no other word. No way should the captain of the team be taking the puck from another teammate. Bad decisions leading to goals. Goaltending sucking the big one. It was awful.

I don&#039;t know if you could say that this is still Boudreau&#039;s after shocks when Anaheim is lighting it up. Could Boudreau win the Jack Adams if Anaheim reaches the playoffs? So does it come down to the players, McPhee, Hunter......I don&#039;t know. What I do know is that this is frustrating as all get out.]]></description>
