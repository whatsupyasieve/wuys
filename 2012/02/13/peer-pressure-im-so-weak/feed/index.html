		<description><![CDATA[WOW....made me forget about Mr. Jonathan Toews for a second...That first picture of Giroux is sexy as hell...might need to make a road trip to Canada...hell Philly!

Marty St. Pierre...friends with him when he played for the Norfolk Admirals...great guy and just as cute in person...will have to dig up some old photos of him and send them to you. My friend, Kim and I used to call him Shorty St. Pierre since he is about as tall as I am!]]></description>
