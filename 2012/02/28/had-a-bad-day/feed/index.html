		<description><![CDATA[I understand that Nash is the lone beam to the Blue Jacket&#039;s house but how long can that beam support the load until cracking under pressure. I understand the sentiments of fans in Ohio and it&#039;s a sad situation but wouldn&#039;t you rather get a few bricks for the guy and build from there. The Blue Jackets problem is goal tending (coming from a Leafs&#039; fan, we know a thing or two about that). Dealt with the Sundin fiasco too and we&#039;re still given the short end of that stick. Nash loves the fans in Ohio but even the fans need to support him with how the management has mishandled the situation and thrown him under the bus. If he wasn&#039;t such a sweet guy, he&#039;d ask ownership to get rid of the management but alas the Jackets will start winning soon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well said, Carlay. We feel you on every count of that.  I hope the Jackets can sort out their issues and do some winning for you guys.  With or without Nash, it&#039;s been a tough road.  I personally love love love to see expansion teams succeed.  We&#039;re all pulling for Columbus gets themselves on that list soon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On Rick Nash: (Be prepared this is long! Sorry!)
I&#039;m an Ohioan. He came to Ohio right about the time I started watching hockey. Rick Nash was the first player I knew. Hearing that the franchise player might be traded is scary. Especially considering the trouble Columbus has been having over the last couple years. My friends that don&#039;t even watch hockey were freaking out over the possibility.

Then, we found out he requested a trade (Insert my heart breaking here). Coming from a state where franchise players always seem to want out when times are tough (Brady Quinn, Lebron James, etc.) It felt like he was giving up on the team. Now I understand it would be better for his career, but honestly it&#039;s devastating to find out even the captain has no hope.

While I am heart broken, I also feel for the guy. Not because he&#039;s &quot;stuck&quot; in Cbus but because no fans are going to stand behind him. He lost their loyalty. I honestly hope he leaves this summer, cause playing in a city that knows you don&#039;t want too be there is going to be torture for him. Trust me, I know Ohioans.... we rarely forgive, but we never forget.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love you Jess. Only you could turn a trade deadline post into a diatribe about the stress of Vancouver playing our beloved Hawks in the playoffs.

And with that, I fully concur. Please Blackhawks, win some games. And Jonathan Toews, I hope your broken head gets better soon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Other than the non-action, the biggest &quot;shock&quot; was probably Cody Hodgson going to the Sabres. But I&#039;m probably biased because I live in Vancouver and got the *delight* of hearing Canucks fans cry into their lulu lemon &quot;NOT COHO! Noooo!&quot; Suck it up princesses. I still hate you.

And John Scott playing the &quot;we just had a baby&quot; card tugged at all of my heart strings, but them&#039;s the breaks I guess. Please Blackhawks, win some games. And win precisely the right number of games so that you don&#039;t play Vancouver in the playoffs BECAUSE I CANNOT HANDLE THAT STRESS.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for being, if not optimistic, hopeful for the non-movements of one GMGM. You&#039;re right - ask us in April if we believe that it&#039;s out of misplaced faith that GMGM has in the Caps. But for now, we&#039;ll lose our voices and lose our money in our pockets (buying tickets left &#038; right) to ROCK THE RED!

And Rick Nash? Sad lumberjack panda - http://oldstersview.files.wordpress.com/2007/07/panda.jpg. :(]]></description>
