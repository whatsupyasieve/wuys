		<description><![CDATA[What is going on here last night, not minutes after the game the phone calls setatrd from friends (that lasted most of the night) about the ONE real culprit from this game.Yes, the Refs were awful, yes it was biased against the Hawks (yet again), yes Bryan Bickell did little with his time, yes Frolik has lost his offensive confidence, yes the loss of Sharp hurt I grant you all of this, but why is NO ONE in the media, Tab included, willing to signal the spanner in the works for these Chicago Blackhawks? And who is this culprit?None other than the $6 million dollar boy, Patrick Kane he has abandoned his team mates for 6 weeks his only value and contribution for this team is in creating offensive scoring chances, and therefore points, 5 on 5 and especially on the PP.He simply isn&#039;t doing these things. Kane&#039;s points came when he was playing Centre predominately between Hossa and Sharp, and various other arrangements, leaving Captain Serious to make his hay with players like Stahlberg and Brunette. When this combination was taken away from Kane, and shifted back to Toews, Kane&#039;s points dried up, and his contributions on the PP all season have been horrific he plays a ton of PP time with the best combinations around him and yet he has 2 goals and 7 assists to show from it. On the season, he has 10 goals and 28 assists playing with 3 of the most dynamic players in the NHL, all of whom have been named as contenders for the MVP award thus far.These are NOT great numbers, and when you take into account the fact that he is a liability in EVERY OTHER aspect of the game, these numbers stand out (especially on the PP) as WEAK at best. We have a ton of money tied into a small forward who does NOT compete for the puck, does not engage in physical play, does not engage in serious zone defensive coverage, does not engage in back checking, and does not practise with any intent of getting better case in point his shot he expressed himself in the offseason that he missed the net far too many times in close last year, what has happened this season, like last night? He constantly misses the net resulting in no rebounds and often odd man breaks the other way.Where is his passion? Where is his desire to compete? Last night on the winning goal, he floated onto the ice when the puck was controlled in our end, playing 4 on 4 hockey, he then skated to his blueline and watched while 4 Red Wing players played TACKLE with his team mates swarming around our goal the RW player had 5 seconds to hold on to the puck and shoot it into the open net because PATRICK KANE stood at the blue line and watched him score.I have asked this question before and from now on I will ask it daily until someone can give me a positive answer what is Patrick Kane doing on this hockey team when he doesn&#039;t score and our team defence is essentially the worst in the league???This isn&#039;t an  unfair  or  biased  rant against Kane as 49 year old, 40 year fan of the Blackhawks, I care about this TEAM and it&#039;s overall success, and not about any one player or coach these factual feelings about Kane come from watching him closely for the better part of 3 seasons, and they are very real.If this team wants to win another Cup, they should bundle up Kane&#039;s name and his perceived greatness and get serious hockey players in return. Players that have beneficial contracts that we can control for a number of years. It is then that we will turn things around and become a legitimate Cup contender, and not the pretenders we have been for a season and a half!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You guys look great!!! So does iCarly and Brooks...always thought Brooks was a good looking guy...even during his AHL days with the Bears.

Do you think the Chicago Auto Show is handing out oxygen masks with their player appearances?? Brent Seabrook&#039;s thighs alone can make a girl pass out....then throw in Stalberg, Kane, and JONATHAN TOEWS??? Each admission ticket should include not only an oxygen mask but your own personal paramedic to administer CPR....or one of the boys could do the CPR/mouth to mouth!!]]></description>

It says something about wristbands, but what they&#039;re REALLY saying is &quot;We&#039;re on to you, fangirls. Don&#039;t make us release the hounds.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I nearly fainted upon seeing this post. iCarly and Brooks look FANTASTIC. You ladies look wonderful as well! I don&#039;t know that I would have been able to hold myself back from hurdling over the table at iCarly, so major props to Gator. She has much more self restraint than I would!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is just so much awesome in this post...you and Gator were looking fierce with those boys.  Brooks shouldn&#039;t be allowed to wear shirts that color, it&#039;s just not fair to the female race.
Love the roommates video.  There was a little estrogen fest at my apartment as Pam and I watched Carly undressing &quot;No, keep going...take it all off!&quot;
When do we leave for Chicago?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mother of god. That shirt! That smile! I&#039;m obviously not talking about Ken Doll, sorry, iCarly here.

How in all that is holy Laich&#039;s underpants could you NOT have told me about this auto show before hand? I&#039;d have gone and gotten myself signed off for two weeks with back issues again and come over.

But then now I&#039;d be in jail. Because unlike Gator, I may not have restraint where Mr Blue Blue Eyes is concerned, even if the Professor did get away entirely unscathed two years ago! I think I may have a problem. Is there a help group? Is is specific for Caps players?

As my field is trauma orthopaedic surgery, can I also volunteer myself to nurse Brooks back to health? I don&#039;t mind a bit of beck and call work. Or rubbing the sore bits better. *evil grin*]]></description>
