		<description><![CDATA[I was upset that the Hawks gave up a four goal lead, but a win is a win and against this Nashville team I&#039;ll take it. I tuhoght Kruger was maybe the best player on the ice. He was smart defensively and made some beautiful passes. If the Hawks don&#039;t  keep Shaw for a very long time that would a huge mistake. His pass to Seabrook on the game winner was amazing. He is so determined and smart. I loe this kid. Stalberg had another solid night and finally seems his hands are catching up to his feet. Crawford was crucial and played well especially in the first. He made a couple incredible saves. The Hawks got into penalty trouble which is why the Predators were able to mount a comeback. They have to stay more disciplined. Good win against a very good team without Toews and Keith who might have been able to prevent the Predators from scoring one or two of their goals while we were on the PK. But thi game makes me 100% sure that I do not want to play Nashville in the first round or any round for that matter.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Stalberg&#039;s english is really good.
Is it easy for Swedes to learn english or are they all just brilliant? They&#039;re probably just all brilliant. Well, at least Stalberg is.
Obviously did not get the &quot;good-with-languages&quot; part of the Swedish genes. Must consult ancestors.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really believe the Hawks played much better last night, they really need help with their defense (defence for our Canadian friends). Leddy is frustrating the hell out of me. I know he&#039;s a kid, but COME ON. Not looking forward to the Rangers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jack and Rose are clearly wading through my tears in that photo. Of course they were going to lose yesterday. It was Valentine&#039;s Day and I love them so NATURALLY they broke my heart. Add to this my Canucks-loving boyfriend who insists the Hawks will be out of the playoffs by this time next week and the fact that I am being ironically retweeted by CBJ fans... it is a really hard time to be a Hawks fan :-( It&#039;s probably a blessing that I will miss 90% of tomorrow&#039;s game... I might find myself cheering for Dan Girardi&#039;s cheekbones, I mean the NYR.]]></description>
