		<description><![CDATA[Is it wrong that when I saw Carlson posting about Hunger Games that I thought the movie was out already and he saw it?  Because I just didn&#039;t picture him laying around reading.  Is that bad of me?  He&#039;s got to be smarter than I think, he was accepted to play college hockey.  But this is the guy that said he retired his writing career back in 2008 (year he graduated from high school) when there was some confusion that he was writing a blog post about him and Karl as roommates and not filming it.

Anyway, go Mike! So nice to see him back.  I&#039;m also going to Caps vs Islanders so I&#039;ll look for some women squealing when Mike skates by at warmups.]]></description>
