		<description><![CDATA[When Ginger Hartnell ran into Hank today while he was in goal, I was screaming at the tv, &quot;Stay away from TEH PRETTEH!&quot;

I mean, it&#039;s unreal. AND he has a twin, who plays hockey in Sweden. YES THERE ARE TWO. Though somehow Joel isn&#039;t as PRETTEH.  But PRETTEH enough.

I&#039;m am convinced that 1,000 years ago, they drowned all the ugly babies at birth in Sweden, and genetically only the gorgeous survived and evolved.

Excellent choice today, Chuck. And loved the gif. I think he forgives ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Rangers really are the prettiest team in the NHL. Lundqvist, Boyle, Callahan, Hagelin have already graced Foxy Friday. Girardi and Del Zotto should be on the list for Future Foxy Fridays. But the one who really needs to be a Future Foxy Friday is Stu Bickel. It is unfortunate that Stu wasn&#039;t seen much on 24/7, or ya&#039;ll would be on the band wagon already. Bickel looks like he stepped out of an A&#038;F ad and on to the ice. I got to meet him after the game last night and I have not been that fan girl over a player since I met Lundqvist. And the cutest thing was when he dropped his 6&#039;4&quot; frame down to his knee to take a picture with a young fan. Bickel left an ocean of fan girl puddles in his wake.]]></description>

DAN GIRARDI DOESN&#039;T EVEN WEAR A VISOR.

Speaking of Dan Girardi, it would be criminal not to make him a future Foxy Friday. HBO has made it impossible to hate on them. IMPOSSIBLE. (Disclaimer: prior to 24/7, they weren&#039;t even on my radar. All I knew is that they had a Staal. Blame my west-coastness). As you say, there is a disproportional amount of foxy on this team. Even Hawks beat reporter Tracy Myers, who is always a total pro and not a puck bunny in disguise (*cough why is Alyonka a thing cough*), allowed herself to fangirl Lundqvist at the ASG. And even men fangirl the NYR! To quote my straight, male co-worker: &quot;Henrik Lundqvist could be a model! Dan Girardi? CRAZY CHISELED FACE.&quot;
