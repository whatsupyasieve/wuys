		<description><![CDATA[Carl is always good to look at! I was fortunate enough to watch him play against my alma mater, Miami University, in hockey 4 times a year. I couldn&#039;t agree more.. much better looking in person and an incredible hockey player. Finally some Michigan love {even though I am a State fan, I&#039;ll take some shoutouts to Michigan anyday.}]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Carl! He was, and still is, loved very much here at Michigan, and we definitely miss him. Makes me proud to see one of our boys having so much success!

And I promise you this, he&#039;s even cuter in person :)]]></description>
