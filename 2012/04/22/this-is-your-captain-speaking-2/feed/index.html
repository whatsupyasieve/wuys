		<description><![CDATA[I admit it, I totally fell asleep before the GWG last night. Okay actually, I fell asleep before the 3rd period, but it was a legit miracle I even made it through the first two periods after ten hours of day drinking. But yeah, thanks for posting the Youtube video since my attention span today is about ten seconds too short to look it up myself. I&#039;m just going to go lay down now.

So yeah, Captain Serious is seriously amazing. Also, Stalberg better turn that shit around before I campaign for him to look pretty from the bench. Only.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[God, I love when Toews takes control. He won that faceoff last night, fished the puck from where it was tied up across the boards and rather than passing to one of his teammates in front of the net he&#039;s like, &quot;Imma just show you idiots how a game is won here - &#039;cuz if I give you the puck you&#039;ll f*ck it up for sure.&quot; BOOM. Scores.

I&#039;ll admit it - I&#039;m terrified of Game 6. I&#039;m what they call as pessimistic hockey fan - just as I was texting Jess &quot;This doesn&#039;t look like a Stanley Cup winning team,&quot; Leddy scored. It was like they could hear me.

Well, I&#039;m praying to the hockey gods for tomorrow and beyond. The next best thing after a possible Vancouver elimination would be Phoenix, following Torres&#039; suspension. I know who I&#039;m rooting for.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[*JUMPY CLAPS*

*HAPPY TEARS*

*LANDESKOGING*

Jonathan Toews... man of my dreams, captain OF MY LIFE.

Please Blackhawks... keep it together. Captain Perfection can&#039;t do it all by himself. I&#039;m looking at you, The Patricks. WIN IT FOR HOSSA!

Sidebar: If Vancouver loses tonight, I am SO SO SO wearing my Chicago jersey to work tomorrow. (Seriously, some of these Canucks zealots are DEFENDING Torres... disgusting. I bet you he will APPEAL the suspension. He better be denied. And even if he is, you think he&#039;s going to change? Shanahan&#039;s video alone showed EIGHT years of suspensions NOT changing him. He should be in prison. Okay, rant over.)]]></description>
