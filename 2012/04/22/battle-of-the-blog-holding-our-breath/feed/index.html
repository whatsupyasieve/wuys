		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s true. We aren&#039;t speaking at all about this series. Our friendship is too important to us and we&#039;d like to keep it intact.

It is also true that I have so much hatred for the Capitals right now.  Lots of rage.

My stomach is already in knots about this game....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Kristen!!!
Also, the line &quot;a llama in ice skates where Ovechkin should be&quot;...dying of laughter, mainly because it&#039;s true. But I rather see the llama.
All I know, is that if the Bruins DO lose (which dear God I pray they don&#039;t) then the Kings better win!I need one of my teams in there!]]></description>
