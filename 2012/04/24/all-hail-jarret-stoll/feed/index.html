		<description><![CDATA[Dear Lindsay,
I have very bad news for you. The Pens and Hawks losing was completely unrelated to the Canucks losing.
In fact, the Pens and Hawks could have won their way to a Stanley Cup final game seven overtime, where after ten O/T periods, the teams would have dragged themselves exhausted onto the ice, and then Slapshot-style started removing their uniforms until Toews, Sharp, Letang and Neal all collapsed in a naked, writhing mass of sweaty, sinewy muscle. And the Canucks would still be out.

Just sayin&#039;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If it took the Blackhawks AND Pens losing so that Vancouver would be eliminated, it was worth it. I figure it&#039;s the universe&#039;s way of telling me that I get ONE nice thing per playoffs. And I&#039;ll take Vancouver losing EVERY SINGLE TIME.

Plus who doesn&#039;t LOVE their trolling Twitter handle?! I may have to take on cheering for LA to win - in addition to their spectacular social media showing, they have Stoll, Richards, Cart and Brown. Good enough for me!]]></description>
