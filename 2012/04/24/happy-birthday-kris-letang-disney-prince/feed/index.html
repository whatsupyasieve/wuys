		<description><![CDATA[As glossy pretty as he is, for me it&#039;s all about his stupid.  I am addicted to his stupidity.  Forget Le SexHair.  It&#039;s more like BOX o&#039; hair.  Not exactly the sharpest knife in the drawer.  But he&#039;s hilarious to behold out there, and I love that stretched out his concussion recuperation to allow his nose to pretty up again.  And here he is PETTING A KITTEH:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoKNFQsmUc  Advance to 2:35.  You&#039;re welcome.]]></description>
