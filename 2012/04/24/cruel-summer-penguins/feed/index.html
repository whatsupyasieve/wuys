		<description><![CDATA[A very touching send-off to an always compelling, iconic bunch of lunatards.  ;)  But c&#039;mon - you&#039;re not &quot;Pants&quot; for nothing, eh?  Can you just admit that the spectacles cap was a convenient excuse to post a crotchtastic shot of Mr. Neal&#039;s Netherregions?  That kinda sounds like a fun kid&#039;s show for grownups, doesn&#039;t it?  &quot;Mr. Neal&#039;s Netherregions&quot;....

For everybody suffering through the bereavement process, hang in there and for sure it would have been extra s***ts and giggles if PIT and CHI had been able to go the distance.   But guess what?  Everything happens for a reason.  And the cure for your blues (ahem) comes in the form of the BEARDASSERY that is the WESTERN CONFERENCE.  The time to troll is now, people.  Get on it and discover all the wild &#039;n wonderful clubs the hockey media ignores that play out West.  The teams also drive the NHL bonkers.  As Ross Perot used to say, &quot;FAYN-tastic!&quot;

It&#039;s worth staying up late and being admonished by your boss.  You shouldn&#039;t be sleeping, anyway.  It&#039;s the playoffs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;He could have been finger painting like Doug Dorsey!&quot; Pants, that has got to be one of the FUNNIEST lines ever written! And I mean, EVER!!! Needless to say, I&#039;m a HUGE Cutting Edge fan, too. I just wish someone in The Room on Sunday would have said, &quot;The difference Is, I&#039;M in the mood to kick a little ass!!!&quot; *sigh*
I am 1000% on board for Nealer in glasses, topless Tanger (and even white boy, Nealer - I&#039;ll help with the SPF 75! Ha ha), and keeping Nisky &#038; Sully!!!!!]]></description>
