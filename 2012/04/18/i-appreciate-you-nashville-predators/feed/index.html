		<description><![CDATA[I had the same problems with GameCenter on the Roku.  I stopped my subscription within the 4 days you get to cancel when you begin it.  I called their support number who was manned by a nice guy, but said there wasn&#039;t anything he could do to fix the problem.  He said the Roku was their most stable service but because iit&#039;s such a basic device, there isn&#039;t any troubleshooting for it.  I have no problems watching live games on my MLS Live app, so this is strictly a GameCenter thing. I wound up buying Center Ice through my cable company which sucked because I didn&#039;t get to choose which feed I wanted to watch, watch highlights or old games.  And yet it was the same price.  Grr.

But I just wanted to confirm it wasn&#039;t your internet connection, your Roku  or any other variables.  I would suggest trying it again next season, because it&#039;s a great service, but remember you do have a few days to cancel it if it&#039;s crappy again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a displaced &quot;Smashvillian&quot; and now in Northern VA.  There is NOTHING like hockey night in Nashville!  Highly recommend it and as long as you are a good natured traveling fan, the worst thing that is going to happen to you is a set of bruised ribs.....from all the hugging.  The place is electric.
Your site is a ton of fun and love the postings.  Be good, y&#039;all and LET&#039;S GO PREDS!!  Who&#039;s next?!!!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Better late than never!!!  :)  I adore this team for a lot of reasons.  I highly recommend visiting Nashville and going to a game because there really is nothing like seeing a game at Bridgestone.  I can&#039;t begin to describe it.  They&#039;ve got their own thing going and while it&#039;s obviously not an &quot;Original Six&quot; vibe, it&#039;s just as worthy and I love that they&#039;ve forged their own identity without being righteous about it.  A special team in a special city.  It&#039;s crazy easy to like this team if you pay attention.  Some teams make it tougher for you to root for them if you&#039;re not a homer.

I quit being a homer when my team was taken away from me many moons ago.  There&#039;s something very liberating about it!]]></description>

Unfortunately, we don&#039;t watch nearly as must Western Conference as we should, but we try.

		<description><![CDATA[Even though I am not in Nashville, this is MY team! Thank you for giving them the props they deserve! I&#039;m a fish out of water being a die hard hockey nut in Utah but I keep up with my guys via Center Ice. Tonight&#039;s game will be a fun one to watch!

Your blog is fun and informative, keep up the good work!

Go Pekks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re making me sad I let my husband have the TV Tuesday night. I actually have only seen about one period of this series but I have lots of love for Nashville and Barry Trotz&#039;s Captain Picard hair. So much better than his previous combover/dark dye job.

If you live in a southern non-hockey market, even here in Dallas with the Stars, you pretty much have to pony up for Center Ice. This season I got GameCenterLive, thinking I could watch on TV with the Roku AS THEY SAID YOU COULD, but I missed a lot of games due to the mind-blowing slowness of the feed.  It was like trying to watch a video online in 1998.  Buffering!  It wasn&#039;t our Internet connection either, because Netflix streaming worked fine. It was madly frustrating. I ended up watching most of the games at my desk on my 13-inch laptop, which is not what I paid $200 for. I haven&#039;t read many experiences like this, but I won&#039;t pay for it again until they do some serious, serious improvements to the streaming quality.]]></description>
