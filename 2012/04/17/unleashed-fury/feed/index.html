		<description><![CDATA[These playoffs are a blatant display of how idiotic most hockey players are. I don&#039;t care if you&#039;re down 3-0, if someone cross-checked you and got away with it, the violence, disrespect and general f*ckery of these playoffs is a testament to how moronic the game can get. And I LOVE hockey.

Ugh - in a way I can&#039;t wait for the first round to be over. Then hopefully things settle down and we can get back to what we really enjoy about playoffs: just watching good hockey.]]></description>
