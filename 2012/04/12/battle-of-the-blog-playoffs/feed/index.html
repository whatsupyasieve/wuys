		<description><![CDATA[I love Pants but IT IS ON LIKE DONKEY KONG.

I&#039;m DYING to see which Caps team shows up tonight.

Poor Holtby. Not sure if the Foxy Friday good luck can help him much tonight. What a way to start your 1st playoff series...facing the defending Stanley Cup champs...on the road...against a team with 4 scoring lines...and 6 20+ goal scorers.

May the best team win.  And by best team, of course I mean the Bruins.  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I suggest recruiting Chuck &#038; Pants &quot;teams/cheerleaders&quot; - a la Worst Cooks in America, when Burrell went up against Flay (and kicked his ass) - and just let your teams do the catfighting for you.  Have THEM summarize/trashtalk this series FOR YOU so that you can then point your newly-shellac&#039;d fingernails at each other without ruining your manicures.  You can just blame the nasty on your &quot;teams&quot; and laugh at how pathetic they are at coming up with fake Bruins v Caps Foxy Fridays; their sad Photoshopping skillz; their even sadder, craptacular dirty play .GIFs; etc. etc.

Pants gets to be Burrell because the Bruins are the defending champs, just like her.  Chuck can bring on the Flay.  Now - GO PICK YOUR TEAMS!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well let&#039;s see.... In my house we just don&#039;t talk and mix I love you and I hate you together every chance we get....Aid tried to dry jump me yesterday in his GingerRoo sweater to get the Flyer germs on me, but I hadn&#039;t taken a shower yet so I thought the hot water and loofah scrubbing worked to get the germs off (maybe not though)...

I am looking forward to the blog while this is going on! I was yelling Chuck vs Pants all around my house when I saw the match up. I have to agree with LIndsay that I&#039;m more excited for your battle than the games...still wishing they both could lose!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Duuuuuuuuuuuude. As soon as this match up was finalized I turned to my husband to proclaim, &quot;The battle of WUYS is ON!&quot; He barely knew what I was talking about (which happens 98% of the time). I can&#039;t help but be more excited about the Chuck vs. Pants battle more than the Bruins vs. Caps themselves.

And Bob McKenzie says it&#039;s just a game. Pffffffffffft.]]></description>
