		<description><![CDATA[As euphoric as it would be to see the Penguins and the Canucks go head to head in the Stanley Cup Finals, I&#039;m pretty sure it would create the biggest amount of inner turmoil I&#039;ve ever experienced in my life. I love them almost equally. Not gonna stop me from rooting for both of them fervently though!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cats, hockey and DD? Plus Karlsson, Letang and Eddie? Yowza.
I take it you have a passport now? Well, enjoy the game, and hopefully you won&#039;t have the two hour border wait I had last weekend. And hopefully, TBG won&#039;t get any more facial injuries. Although I didn&#039;t hear any cries of &quot;Not the face!&quot; during game one , but maybe you can&#039;t yell that loud?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not only can he read and has wireless, he ordered me a whole Pittsburg Penguins sweat outfit! I was shocked I tell you when it showed up on my doorstep! Shocked &#038; outraged - since he also charged it to my credit card. But I didn&#039;t want to hurt his feelings so I&#039;ve been wearing it. ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You know your cat can read, right? And has wireless?

Have a great time on your trip and please be careful.  The border guards took one look at my &quot;I Love Canadian Boys&quot; bumper sticker and had themselves a laughing fit.  Maybe because my dad was driving at the time. (True story.)

Say &quot;Cheeseburger!&quot; to Drew for us!]]></description>
