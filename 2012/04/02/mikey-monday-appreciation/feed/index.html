		<description><![CDATA[Oxidizing agents are usually hydrogen peroxide, and the alkaline environment is usually provided by ammonia. The combination of hydrogen peroxide and the primary intermediate causes the natural hair to be lightened, providing a &quot;blank canvas&quot; for the dye. Ammonia opens the hair shaft pores so that the dye can actually bond with the hair and speeds up the reaction of the dye with the hair.*-

		<description><![CDATA[Becky, I forgot about that girl! When they pulled 00 we were all looking around like, &quot;Uhhhhh.....&quot; and then Gator said, &quot;Well THAT sucks.&quot;  Too true!

Or maybe it was a kindness.  One good hug from, say, Karl Alzner, and her expectations of real boys would be shot for life]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good to see Nicky B back.  He is adorable but I can&#039;t get over that I think he looks 14.  Maybe it is because I just had a birthday and am having to start facing the fact that I am getting old!

I felt bad for that poor teenage girl that got the mascot&#039;s jersey.  Really? Everyone else gets a player and she gets the mascot?  Cheated, I say!!

Love the suspenders.  My 9 year old son wears them and they even look adorable on him.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think one of Mike&#039;s suspender is hanging behind him.  (We really like those too.)  If you&#039;ve seen the 21 Jump Street remake, you know it&#039;s all about two straps. ;)

iCarly&#039;s a giant, plus skates, but I think that lady is also really small. I felt like she wanted to take a step back as he skated toward her!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So I just have to get this out there...I adore the under jersey suspenders. But what&#039;s up with Mike&#039;s? Is that one suspender? Does he tuck his jersey and his other suspender got in the way?
And is Carlson really that giant or is that lady just very petite?]]></description>
