My brother aka the resident Flyers fan would like to thank you for advancing his case for conversion...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am just back from my Hockey Trip 2012 vacation - wherein I saw the Prince of Canada score (Crosbot - sex on skates!), met The Kitchenette AND Pants. My mind is still blown. And I saw the Rangers play at MSG - it&#039;s been a tough 3 days reminding myself that I ALREADY have to teams to cheer for and I cannot love another.

I will say that having been to Consol does WEIRD things to your lady parts - honestly, how could you NOT be in love with the Pens?? And there&#039;s ginormous photos of Crosby everywhere - all part of the conspiracy to kill fangirls everywhere. Fact.]]></description>

Admitting my age here but I saw Pierre coach in action when I lived in Louisiana.  The Baton Rouge Kingfish - ECHL I think.  If I had only known then what I know now ...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The coach fight was the greatest thing I have ever seen. I was waiting for one of them to slip and fall on Pierre. That would have been HIGHLIGHT OF THE MILLENIUM.

Also, Crosby is obviously an inhumanly talented player and I owe him fealty as he is the Prince of Canada, and he is cute and all, but I am not, as I have previously mentioned, an #87 fangirl. However, THAT PICTURE. I am now sobbing gently on the bus, stroking my iPhone screen, cooing &quot;I love you, Sid. I love you.&quot;

Not weird.]]></description>
