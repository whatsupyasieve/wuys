		<description><![CDATA[I find Flames fans are cut from the same mould as Canuck fans. After living in BC for years I can&#039;t stand them. The Flames fans I&#039;ve encountered since moving to Edmonton haven&#039;t been any smarter.

The best part about the Flames is that they have mediocre aging players who all have NTCs. So they&#039;ll be in this situation for quite a while. :)

Oilers may not have made the playoffs in 6 years and finished with a lottery pick three years in a row but at least we&#039;re in a much better situation than the Flames.]]></description>

Also, we need to clone Martin St. Louis.  I want one of my very own.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank God I&#039;m not a Flames fan. Most fans are delusional every spring, holding out hope that the team will make the playoffs, only to have the Flames finish a few spots out (hello, 10th place!), which puts them in a terrible position for draft picks, a refusal to trade Iginla and/or Kiprusoff, and down the path of rinse and repeating for seasons to come.

Now that I cheer for other teams, I realize what the defining characteristic of a Flames fan is, as per my dad - hating teams like San Jose or Chicago. Because they&#039;re the ones that beat the Flames ALL THE TIME. Oh, well - here&#039;s to getting a head start on your handicap on the golf course, boys.]]></description>
