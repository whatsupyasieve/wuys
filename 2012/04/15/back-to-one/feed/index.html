		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with you Pants. Hawks are my #1 since I grew up loving them i.e. the old Denis Savard days, but the Caps and Pens are deeply rooted in my heart now.

I had to stop watching the Caps game to take my son to a Chicago Wolves game. Thank goodness for smartphones. I whooped when I saw that the Caps won. Then my Hawks won.....so I felt infinitely better. Though I love me some Gingeroux, the Pens seriously need to win. Also, none of this 8-5 crap. I want a tight 2-1 win by the Pens.]]></description>
