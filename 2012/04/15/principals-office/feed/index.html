Was actually developed by the University of Florida for their football players like 40+ years ago to replace the fluids and sodium they lose. Prevents cramping too.

		<description><![CDATA[More importantly, how many games will Dubrinsky get for abuse of the gatorade container?  And what is gatorade anyway?  I&#039;m on the other side of the pond, and haven&#039;t seen it over here.  I&#039;m assuming it&#039;s some sort of high energy sticky sweet creation...
in which case the people nearby who got splattered must have been delighted. Not that I blame him, sometimes when you&#039;re THAT angry something needs to die.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Applause for goalie comparison line. That&#039;s good stuff. I halfway regret dinner and the theater last night (As You Like It - my husband has a Shakespeare obsession) instead of watching the games. I did need some space though. Friday&#039;s Pens game came close to killing me. So while I can&#039;t speak on yesterday&#039;s penalties, I will say I&#039;ll probably get two for instigating with my Flyers fan neighbor today. (Who knew that Fayetteville, NC could be such a rough hockey town?!)]]></description>
