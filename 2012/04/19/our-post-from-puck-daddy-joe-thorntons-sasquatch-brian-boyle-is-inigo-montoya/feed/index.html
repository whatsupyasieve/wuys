		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s Shea Weber gettin&#039; his licks in (from last year).  This year, he decided against the whole headstart thing and grew it from scratch when the playoffs commenced (as did Burnzie - I give you props for your fair play, Burnzie you poor sorry Shark, you!).  He&#039;s off and running now - and will catch up to Dumbo soon enough - but nobody&#039;s excited about his beard this year for obvious reasons, eh?  His Beardathon total is pretty sad, also.  :(

But how awesome that Kleiner&#039;s art project on his face has finally been recognized!  A very cool assortment/collage aux barbes for the first week, I must say.  Jordan Staal&#039;s Amish is also growing a LOT faster than it has in the past.  Would you consider doing year-by-year compare and contrasts?  That might be bizarrely interesting!

Where do sideburns/chops fit in, if at all?  If somebody&#039;s got Danzig burns, does that count?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i&#039;m digging boyle&#039;s pirate look, but i must say i&#039;m a little disappointed that we are being robbed of seeing his full-on beard potential (which in my mind is dark and full and glorious.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pants/chuck are corruptors of hockey morals! Before I found them I was a good little Caps fan; never knew what players on other teams looked like. Claude Giroux? I pictured the French race car driver from the Ricky Bobby movie! Then WuYs featured him and I see he&#039;s hotness on a stick! Literally!]]></description>
