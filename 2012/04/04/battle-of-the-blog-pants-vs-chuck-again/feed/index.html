		<description><![CDATA[I hope both Boychuk and Vitale are ok.  Both incidences looked bad.  As far as Letang is concerned, he (and their PP) is too skilled to resort to such antics.  It&#039;s not necessary.

Totally random bandage thought I had this weekend: As I pulled out the &quot;Zoe&quot; bandage out of the Sesame Street box, I couldn&#039;t help but think that she looks just like Jakob Voracek. My mind goes to the weirdest places!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ok, we&#039;ll agree to disagree.

UGH...I saw how he recorded a 208 mph slapper in the ASG....NO THANK YOU!!!

And for the record, no I&#039;m NOT a &quot;Puck Bunny&quot; in the true sense of the word! I like looking at the pretties, but I&#039;m also a real fan of the game!!! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Personally, I think that Ference won that fight, but let&#039;s agree to disagree, k?

Just ask Gregory Campbell how it feels to take a Chara slapshot.  He took one off the foot the other day and he hasn&#039;t played in a few games.  It&#039;ll leave a mark.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I gotta tell you, Ference squaring off with Nealer was EPIC! Even better was that Nealer, not known for his fighting (because it might mess up his glorious hair, ya know!) KICKED HIS ASS!!!!

Vitale....OWIE!!! I wouldn&#039;t want to take ANY kind of shot off Chara&#039;s stick with ANY part of my body! Hope Jo-Jo is ok to go for the Playoffs!!!

And Nisky...oh, Nisky. We NEED YOU, TOO!!! Please be ok.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[And the Oscar goes to Kris Letang!  There were at least two seconds between that stick tap and the overblown reaction.  Refs can be so stupid sometimes.  Grrrr.
Watching Ference go all David on Neal&#039;s Goliath was fantastic.  AND I seriously hope Johnny Blue-eyes is ok, because we need him for the playoffs.]]></description>
