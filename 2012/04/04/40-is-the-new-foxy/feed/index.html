		<description><![CDATA[I wish he were too!!! And, I do have to admit, I really don&#039;t think there is anything hotter than an angry James Neal.....

And the Bruins defense has definitely left a lot to be desired unfortunately...
They best be stepping it up big time in the playoffs!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The PensInsider blog folks are really funny.  They once had a picture of James standing still with the caption like, &quot;Not sure what Neal&#039;s doing here, but a goal is imminent.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pants, I agree on the leaving a scoring machine open in front of the damn net! Our D does it with respect to effing Simmonds EVERY. DAMN. GAME!!! He freaking SITS on the back door (pretty much whenever they&#039;re in the O Zone!) and yet NO ONE picks him up! Um, what???? I&#039;m just a fan, watching on tv from home, but *I* have figured out where Simmonds likes to go. Why can&#039;t these guys??? Baffled &#038; SMDH!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yea yea.  James Neal is good. His hair is awesome. I get it.  I refuse to acknowledge the goal just because then maybe it won&#039;t happen again.

Every time he touches the puck, it is like &quot;oh here&#039;s a goal&quot; and then there is a goal.  It is frustrating.  And annoying.  Because I wish he was on my team.

Also that first Crosby goal?  Bs defense - how are you going to just leave him all alone like that.  It&#039;s stupid.  You know what is going to happen if you do that. He. Will. Score.]]></description>
