		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t even know what to say about that photo....which is worse, the blurry, soft-focus, porn feel to the photo OR his leg?? I can&#039;t decide.

Mike was on TSN in Canada this morning and dammit Pants - his hair! He really has been studying Patrick Sharp&#039;s do for tips and seems to have gotten the hedgehog, messy situation down. Good work Mikey!]]></description>
