		<description><![CDATA[I have never head the phonebooth as loud as it was last night! I had tears when Neuvy went down... I really hope its not a serious injury.  I&#039;m so proud of the Caps for battling back and clinching a play-off spot!  I always knew they could do it even when the media wrote them off 3+ months ago as not making it to post-season play.  Congrats boys!!!!  No more injuries please... we just got Nicky and Greener back and Neuvy might be out- I can&#039;t handle anyone else being sidelined.  I head to Toronto in 2 weeks for work, debating wearing my Caps jersey on the flight....  I&#039;m sure that would go over real well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the caps provoking so much angst/depression of late, I have enjoyed the hell out of the entertainment provided by the Pens this past week.  Sunday&#039;s side-splitting antics of the last few minutes of pens-flyers (and then Milbury putting Bylsma in a dress, followed by having to apologize to Sid/Dan/Pens for trashing them)  Berube&#039;s smack talk about the Pens, and then the ever-lovable Torts going ape-shit last night.  Can you imagine Torts reaction in the unlikely event they played and were beaten by the Caps in the playoffs??? He&#039;d self-incinerate and leave behind only smoking ashes!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wonder if I could get my doctor to write a script for Xanax...when he asks why, I&#039;ll just reply &quot;Playoffs&quot;

The only thing that makes me more nervous than the Flyers/Pens first round is the possibility that the Flyers could play the Caps at some point and then I&#039;ll just have a meltdown]]></description>
