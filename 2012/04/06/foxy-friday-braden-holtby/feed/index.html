		<description><![CDATA[Holtby takes me back to my Judd Nelson loving-St. Elmo&#039;s Fire watching days in college.  **Sigh**  The best part is watching his OCD/goalie quirks come out when he squirts his water from his bottle over the goal and counts the drops as they fall...oh! the concentration! ;) C&#039;mon Holts! Mama needs a good playoff run for a change!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love you guys, but you can&#039;t do this to me. Dangle these hot Caps players in front of my face when you know I&#039;m a loyal Pens fan. While reading, I had to keep reminding myself, &quot;You are a Penguins fan. Braden Holtby plays for the Capitals and you are a Penguins fan.&quot;

You&#039;re killing me here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for clarifying who the other goalie was today.  My husband and I couldn&#039;t figure it out and you could tell he wasn&#039;t very comfortable being out there on the ice.  Holtby also looked good on the ice and when I say good, I mean HOT!  We almost got his autograph and I wish I would have snapped a pic for you ladies, but I was so awestruck!  I&#039;m still holding out hope for Neuvy, though!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Holy Batman... I was watching the post-game last night and thought &quot;Braden Holtby needs a proper Foxy Friday fan-girling&quot;. I saw Braden in person over the summer at Kettler, he is beyond foxy in person.  (I may have been drooling on myself and I know I was having problems forming words)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So cute! But then again, I&#039;m partial to goaltenders. I also love the way you worked the word &quot;straddle&quot; into the post. Happy Foxy Friday!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There was some Twitter anxiety last p.m. during the Pens/Rangers game about Neuvy going down. ( I think Neuvy is adorable, hope he&#039;s ok)  Then I heard Vokoun and Neuvy were both hurt.  I wondered who was going to be their net minder? I&#039;d never heard of Holtby before or SEEN him:p Thanks WUYS for introducing new hockey hotties to me!]]></description>
