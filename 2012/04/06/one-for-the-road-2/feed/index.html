		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the acknowledgement :) Felt like you were giving the dead teams a moment of silence!
Habs have done pretty well recently, not to mention their drought is about 2 decades old; Leafs fans, on the other hand, are running out of patience. I have never seen the fans this frustrated with this franchise and we have seen some tough times. This season was brutal and felt like a bomb going off in our faces. :&#039;(]]></description>
