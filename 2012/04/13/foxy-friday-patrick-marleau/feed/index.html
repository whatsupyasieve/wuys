		<description><![CDATA[While I would tag him as more of a hedgehog than a fox, I am very pleased to see SOMEBODY giving this poor sod some sugar.  I live in the Bay Area and let me tell you, people LOVE picking on and picking apart poor Patrick 25/7 for like just about anything.  They call him a weenie.  They call him gutless.  They call him stupid.  They laugh at his eyebrows.  I detest the Sharks for a lot reasons, but he&#039;s one of their good eggs and I wanna kill JR when - of all guys! - he goes off on Paddy.  Ridiculous.

Loyalty is right.  His team took away his C and he resigned with them anyway largely because his in-laws are based here.  He&#039;s a good man.  A foxy hedgehog.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Patrick Marleau is our age, Chuck - eleventy billion sounds about right.  I am the all-time leader of nothing.

Also I think you and Pat should trade phones, so he can call me and you can call Crosby (and conference me in).]]></description>
