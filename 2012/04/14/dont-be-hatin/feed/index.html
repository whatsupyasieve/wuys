I LOVE HOCKEY FANS - any kind. They have the best sense of humor.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry this is a few days late but I purposely boycotted the web this weekend to protest the way too many playoff teams are flushing their professionalism and mad skillz down the proverbial toilet.  We all handle our PTSD in different ways, right?  I just couldn&#039;t deal.

But having said that, I need to applaud you for making me laugh again and I congratulate you on your chutzpah in Vancouver.  I too am cheering for the Kings - I actually picked them to go all the way at the beginning of the season - and not to jinx anything but their play is a breath of fresh air in the midst of all the goonery, brain-farting and testosto-buffoonery happening in the other series.  They seem to understand that this is hockey, not the UFC. So good on them!  Plus, I never fully realized just how much Darryl Sutter looks and moves like a chicken.  Fascinating!

Wouldn&#039;t it be something else if the Canucks and the Pens - most experts&#039; picks for the SCF - were booted in the first round?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is awesome, Dawn! I am also convinced Jonathan Quick is a god in net....I know as a Bruins fan I should be saying that about Timmy, but since LA is my (very close) number 2 team, I think I&#039;m good....and I applaud the sign! Ballsy to do in Canada! lol
I met Lewis a couple times when he was in Manchester too....but man does he look all grown up now that he&#039;s in LA...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I applaud your bravery, Dawn. Having been &quot;the enemy&quot; at Rogers Arena on several occasions, I know it can be a rough go. It definitely helps being a girl, I think :P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can you please get new sweatpants that say CHEESEBURGER across the butt?  I think of you every time I see that stupid Bridgestone tire puck-shooting commercial where Drew looks all annoyed.  I&#039;m sure he saw your sign and was cheered beyond measure!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so glad you had a great time at the game, because 5 happy people out of 18,630 isn&#039;t bad, and also glad that everyone was nice to you. Pretty sure it only takes DD fifteen minutes to grow a playoff beard, but you got some great photos in any case.
But that Jumbotron photo...it&#039;s almost like you don&#039;t want us to know what you look like, Dawn.]]></description>
