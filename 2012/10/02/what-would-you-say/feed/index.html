		<description><![CDATA[Given I lost the power of speech when I met the Professor (an occurrence that still gets a laugh around WUYS towers), Jess&#039; predicament  would be understandable.  I mig add it took 6 months of practice before I managed to say thank you.  Good job he came over to my neck of the woods so I could manage it. That, I hasten to add, was about it before I ran away (not kidding - I ran away... Wearing a 37 Bruins game jersey).

Shortly after this, the combined coaching and support team of the Bruins started buying me alcohol. Memories of this evening shall remain classified except to say it involved four random Canadian fans, copious amounts of JD, some interesting activity in a corner with one of the random Canadians (Sens fan. Best left alone).... Best to leave it alone now methinks.

And hang on a minute, what with the lockout and the fact that people here look at you blankly when you mention the local team (looks like I will get some hockey viewing action then during the lockout), is Jon really expecting? Well Jon&#039;s bird?  Or is that a wishful futuristic dream thought?  

Speaking of sprogs, any news on impending LePretty junior???]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s from a 5-part BHTV series that Toews and Kane did a couple years ago where they went to a rink to do a practice session with some youth players, the whole thing is super adorable. The &quot;I&#039;m stuck&quot; thing is in part 1 at about 1:35 into the video.

		<description><![CDATA[EVERY POSSIBLE FEELING!

He is the oldest man in the world. I do not feel at all bad about the chronological differences in our ages sine he probably unironically puts &quot;the&quot; in front of proper nouns: The Twitter, The iTunes, The Facebook an so forth.

More important than the news of his haircut (although I do miss the Superman curl) is the fact that he ha been organizing team skates during the lockout AND PAYING FOR THEM OUT OF HIS OWN VERY DEEP POCKETS*. But he is absent this week. A Chicago sports reporter ran into him at the airport on his way to The Winnipeg and there was some reference to a &quot;training program&quot;. Lindsay and I have SO MANY QUESTIONS. I mean, he wasn&#039;t sitting on his very perfect ass in Chicago, so what possible training could this be? Advanced Squats (although he&#039;d teach that class)? Beginner&#039;s Swedish (because we can only deny the inevitable for so long)? Lindsay briefly suggested it was some sort of rehab which is UNCONSCIONABLE. To maintain sanity, I am telling myself it is some manner of coaching/leadership training.

Don&#039;t be gone long Jon... I miss you.

Such a good man....
