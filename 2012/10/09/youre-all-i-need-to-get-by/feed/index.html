That BU victory was the most epic.  The sheer drama and ballsy move by Jack Parker to pull the goalie with 3 min left, down 3-1 will forever live in infamy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So I revisited your beautiful blog for a little pick me up since I am upset about the NHL season. But as I am reading I see the clip of my beloved alma mater hockey team Miami University in their worst moment! Goodness, I will never forget that day. I was present at that game and I wish I wasn&#039;t... but hey hockey fans go through a lot, huh? I think that is what makes us so tough. 

But cheers to college hockey. I am still watching Miami hockey and attending the boyfriend&#039;s games so hopefully those games will fill the hockey void. I pray!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[College hockey is all I have right now also. Hopefully I&#039;ll be able to catch a few games at my alma mater (Michigan) but I&#039;ve at least got Northern Michigan University (small school, but D1 hockey) right in my backyard so I get some live action on a regular basis!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To be fair, I did make words to Intern Jeff Skinner. I said &quot;Congratulations&quot; (for winning the Calder) and &quot;Thank you&quot; after he took a picture with me. My exchange with Looch was much the same.

I will never be able to make words to Jonathan Toews. I have just accepted this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jess, I so proud of you.  You made the words to the hockey player and didn&#039;t pass out.

See! You&#039;re going to be just fine.

BTW - Cotton Eyed Joe makes me very stabby.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hear you. While there is a college team in Vancouver, UBC isn&#039;t my alma mater, and they don&#039;t play many home games.

HOWEVER, Vancouver also has the Vancouver Giants of the WHL/CHL and, despite living down the street for 5 years, I went to my first game this weekend. IT WAS LEGIT. SO EXCITING. Fast paced, hard hitting, these boys too will be in the NHL one day very soon. It was high caliber hockey and you forget in an instant the some of the players were born in NINETEEN NINETY SIX. They played Cotton Eye Joe in the arena and I was like &quot;This song? OLDER THAN THE TEAM.&quot;

AAAAANNNDD... as I was leaving the arena I literally bumped into Giants-alum Milan Lucic, who was very gracious when I asked for a picture. That&#039;s right folks, I made words to an NHL player. This is progress. No sign of Giants co-owner Michael Buble though, but he was at the game...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry, you used a Torchwood gif and it rendered me a sobbing, hysterical mess like at the end of Children of Earth.  WELP. Never cried so hard at a TV show or movie in my life.

I will re-read when I have composed myself.  Maybe while singing a John Barrowman ditty.
