		<description><![CDATA[The cameras cannot turn away from Sid&#039;s beauty. Every time TSN reports on the lockout they seem to find Sid in a corner of an arena somewhere looking SO GODDAMN gorgeous I can&#039;t turn away. And now this video? Now I know what everyone was losing their sh*t about on Twitter last night. His SKIN and that hair. UNFFFFF]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I go back and forth on Sid, and I think it&#039;s not so much about him as other people&#039;s reactions to him..the fanboys and the middle aged **cough, Pierre**&#039; creepers.   He seems to have grown into himself somehow and seems more at ease lately.  

It&#039;s also seemed to me that he almost seems kind of relieved to be getting screwed over with everyone else during this lockout, like maybe some of the wall between him and the other players has come down.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I never consider myself a Sid-fangirl, but every once in a while he shows up looking like THIS, with that skin and a hairline that makes Jonathan Toews - and I say this with love -  weep into his Rogaine, and I&#039;m all: WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE SIDNEY CROSBY?! 

I miss the NHL.

Sigh.]]></description>
