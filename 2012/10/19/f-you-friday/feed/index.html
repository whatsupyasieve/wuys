		<description><![CDATA[I actually cried at work yesterday when I heard all of the news coming out of the meeting. Not my finest moment.

But I just want the game back. I want all the boys back in North America. I want to hate the Canadiens while secretly cheering for Prusty. I want to see Adam McQuaid punching people in the face while looking like the hottest lunatic on the block. I want to watch 24/7 to hopefully see Joff play the guitar and make fun of Phil Kessel. I want Sid and Claude to break some more wrists.

I just want it all back. Get it done already.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[(Lockout sadness aside...)

Somebody snapped a pic of Toews shopping for a Halloween costume the other day. I am now PRAYING that is Avengers. If the universe is kind to us, there will be pictures.

Also, I cannot even DISCUSS the hotness of these men in suits, or specifically the way Sid is destroying that t-shirt or Jon&#039;s waffle-weave boyfriend shirt because I will lose my mind.

I just figure the NHL has given me carte-blanche to longer be accountable for my thoughts or actions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Honestly....this sums up all of my raging emotions. My emotions that have gone unchecked - ranging from hormonal at the sight of these boys in suits again....to rage that both sides can&#039;t make a deal.

I get that the players want a fair deal and I haven&#039;t delved too much into the specifics of the offers but someone mentioned yesterday that the players had made more than $1 billion in concessions. Which gets me thinking....&quot;You have billions of concessions to make and we can&#039;t get a deal done?&quot;

At the end of the day I just want hockey. And a world where I see these hot men demonstrate their ridiculous talent on the ice. Where the sight of my Pens and Hawks clothing in the closet doesn&#039;t make me weep.]]></description>
