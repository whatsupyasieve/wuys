		<description><![CDATA[I spent longer than is acceptable trying to think up new lyrics to &quot;Favorite Things&quot; from Sound of Music to express my love of freshmen/rookies in a way that wasn&#039;t either terrible or creepy but I failed. Simply put: those two boys are CUUUUUUUUTE.

If there is one good thing about this lockout (Ugh), it&#039;s that I&#039;ve discovered other ways to get my hockey fix. I&#039;ve been to two WHL games and plan to go to many more even when the NHL comes back because - HEY! - I can actually afford it. I&#039;d be happy to do a Canadian major-junior recap for y&#039;all :-)

And I&#039;m going to the Canucks charity game tomorrow night. I feel so DIRTY, but that&#039;s what I get for living in Vancouver. I am actually *really* tempted to fly to Chicago next week for the charity game there...

Long Live Hockey.
