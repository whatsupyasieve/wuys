		<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t agree more, and the fact that it&#039;s just coming out now points to it being the League&#039;s plan all along to Lock Out as a Negotiating tactic. Obviously, they didn&#039;t think fan outrage would be what it has been and it smacks of backpedaling on their part to propose a relatively fair deal at this point. I could be wrong, but that&#039;s how I see it from where I sit. I just hope that now they can work together &#038; get it DONE so we can have hockey back!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What I don&#039;t understand is, why not put this proposal on the table back in July instead of the initial one the owners did? This is definitely one to work/negotiate from. If the owners had proposed this one first, there probably wouldn&#039;t be a lockout right now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I suppose I&#039;m saying this because I&#039;m a novice with NHL matters, but it seems like a relatively fair deal to me.  I also suppose that might hinge on the whole of HHR.  What is the current definition anyway?]]></description>
