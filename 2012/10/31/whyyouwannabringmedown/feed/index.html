		<description><![CDATA[You know Lindsay, much as I miss hockey, I have to say: your new life sounds pretty amazing. Not only the organized, creative, social part but women&#039;s sports getting their due?

Now that I think about it, I&#039;ve also been entertaining and getting things done...could there be a link?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Toronto Raptors game was on when I was at the gym. Can we discuss how depressing this sport is? Maybe it&#039;s just the franchise. Regardless, my options are LIMITED and I do not appreciate these boys running around with playoff beards. NOT FAIR.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I too had tickets to the Pens/Caps game :(  It was gonna be my first live game because I finally have a job that pays enough that, after saving up for months, I was able to afford tickets. And my first game was gonna be the Halloween Pens/Caps game, I mean, you cannot pick a better first game! Now that&#039;s not gonna happen. I Literally can&#039;t express how depressed I am tonight.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I feel your pain. I actually watched baseball and basketball games. And my roommate and I were thinking of taking up scrapbooking.

Although, I do have an AHL team in my town and they are now the object of my devotion. Should anyone need a fix, I HIGHLY recommend it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Last night they did a panel discussion on Sportsnet on women&#039;s downhill skiing. Followed by women&#039;s golf and university volleyball. This is what sports highlights have come to in this lockout hell.

And we all know how my personal habits have changed - crafting, meeting people for drinks, hosting dinner parties - BUYING HALLOWEEN CANDY A MONTH IN ADVANCE. 
 
What is this world coming to?? In the absence of seeing this beautiful men play anyone on skates has reduced me to a hormonal mess. I&#039;m going to spend tonight watching 24/7 and eating said Halloween candy while I cry all of the tears. DAMN YOU BETTMAN.]]></description>
