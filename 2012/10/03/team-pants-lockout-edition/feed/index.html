		<description><![CDATA[My team is feeling a little unloved, what with all the drooling I&#039;m doing over your team and all, but considering I forgot about the draft until about midnight last night and had it set up to auto pick, I didn&#039;t do too bad...my brick wall of goalies will save me if my D can&#039;t.

I met Bobby Ryan today after he skated with the Fly-guys in NJ and informed him that he&#039;s on my team and I would appreciate &quot;Bettman getting his shit together so you can win me some damn points!&quot; (nervous verbal diarrhea FTW!) He wholeheartedly agreed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think I need a visual aide for my team too, since I also drafted some hotness. And we need to discuss Clowe... I remember saying a few expletives when you drafted him... Silently and with respect, of course since you have a kick a$$ blog. ;)
Looking forward to the challenge in this league -- now can hockey just start, please? Before I have a mental breakdown?

&#039;Til then. Support group &#038; this blog will be necessary.

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t see how you can possibly lose. :) I had a similar team last year and dominated my league with it! Go, Team Pants!

While we&#039;re being honest, yes, I DID rank Neal #1 in my yahoo leagues this year. Maybe I missed some points there, but...his hotness will more than make up for it. I mean, I have my priorities! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Aww... I so wanted to play this year but I&#039;m going to have some real life realness to deal with this season and won&#039;t be able to give it the attention it deserves.

Besides, it&#039;s probably for the best since, I love you Pants but, I might&#039;ve had to cut you.

Has anyone used drafting the ugliest possible team as a fantasy strategy? I guess most of them are known for their punching, not their points. Although, with Ovi (provided he tries), Malkin (sorry I&#039;m not sorry... He seems lovely, but....) and the Sedins, you&#039;d probably be in for a decent shot at top 3.]]></description>
