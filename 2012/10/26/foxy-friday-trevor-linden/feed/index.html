		<description><![CDATA[Sorry Linz, this was my doing. And I completely forgot about the Clearly Contacts commercials when I made my nomination. They make me laugh so much, mostly because my friend gets violently upset by them and his pointing at empty space. I think she ranks high on the autism spectrum.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Crafting?
Oh no.
You&#039;ve gone over the edge.

I&#039;m sorry - I don&#039;t like the Canucks either but I can&#039;t hate on Trevor Linden.  I just can&#039;t. 

It&#039;s like hating puppies. Impossible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Uuuugggggghhh like all other aspects of the lockout you are TOYING with my emotions Chuck. Trevor Linden??? My Canucks hate can&#039;t protect me against the hair. THAT hair. Like a fine wine, Linden has gotten better with age. Fabulous.

This is like salve on a burn with the news that the NHL is cancelling games until November 30. What am I going to do until then??  I can only work out so much and clean my house every week and cook dinner like a normal person. I&#039;ve even been crafting. What?! Stop the madness. Maybe it is time to give Linden a ring...]]></description>
