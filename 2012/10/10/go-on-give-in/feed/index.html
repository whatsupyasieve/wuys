This is too awesome for words.  I have a lot of family in Germany so it&#039;s tough to decide who to root for.  But look:  They&#039;re wearing jerseys that say &quot;GAS&quot; on them.  ???  

I prefer the jerseys sported by these two &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esbg.de/index.php?option=com_content&#038;view=article&#038;id=3350:nhl-cracks-bereichern-die-zweite-bundesliga&#038;catid=68:news-1213&#038;Itemid=200&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;bros&quot;...&lt;/a&gt;  Now, THAT&#039;S more like it.  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was lol&#039;ing through the entire press conference so hard. The way that the interpreter would every once in a while put words in their mouths was hilarious! The best one was when Giroux was talking about playing one of the Berlin players and he said something along the lines of &quot;...he was the best player on his team, and we didn&#039;t get along very well...&quot; and the interpreter changed that to &quot;...he was the best player on his team, and I was the best on mine, so we didn&#039;t get along well...&quot; 

Lol, just making Giroux look like he has a massive ego...

Also, the way they would giggle at each other when they had no idea what the others were talking about...

P.s. you forgot the umlaut- it&#039;s EisbÃ¤ren... (insert snotty fyi tone). Quick tip for journalistic integrity, since it&#039;s looking like they&#039;re gonna be here for a while, if you are too lazy/ can&#039;t find an umlaut, just put an e after the letter that should have an umlaut. so Ã¤=ae, Ã¶=oe (&#060;- convenient for when talking about this Friday&#039;s game against my adopted city of KÃ¶ln...)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The only good thing to come out of the lockout! 
And the first time itÂ´s actually good to be German. I can see them play the game on Friday night live on the internet instead of either waking up for it at 3 in the morning or just catching the highlights on the next day.
And I can understand the whole press conference, which is pretty great :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Siiiiiiiigh.

I entertained a brief thought of kidnapping him for you last week, Pants, but I could barely complete a coherent thought in front of the man, and wasn&#039;t quite certain I could covertly fit him and his bag of gear in to the trunk of my Camry with my hands shaking.  Now he&#039;s fled the continent with his ginger-hued lover and my chances are blown!]]></description>
