		<description><![CDATA[Just think of all the black t-shirts and hipster gear he can get with his new found fortune.

While I appreciate the Mike Green, I sincerely hope for everyone&#039;s sake that he manages to put together a worthy season.  All these injuries need to stop.

So curious to see what will happen with Semin and more importantly if any of the draft picks will make the team.  Personally I&#039;m rooting for Tom Wilson to make the team.  Maybe they&#039;ll pair him with Green.

		<description><![CDATA[I was trapped in traffic when I read about the new deal yesterday and my dance of joy kept surrounding motorists entertained for at least 45 seconds...then it was probably debatable whether I was having a seizure.

So happy for Mike, even if he sounds like the Canadian version of Eyeore in his phone interview.  Dude, you just got paid, work a smile into your voice!]]></description>
