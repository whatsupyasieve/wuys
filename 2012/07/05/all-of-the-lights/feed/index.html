		<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t handle Nash in Philly.  I&#039;d lose my job and probably be the recipient of a restraining order.  Though if my Lobster goes to the Pens I&#039;ll play his Under Armour commercial on a loop and sob into my CBJ jersey.  Hey, GMGM...help us out!?!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[NO KIDDING.  If Zach gets injured and is taken out for an entire season like what happened last year, I shudder to think...  It&#039;s a LOT of money to sink into two guys.  Sutes has hardly ever been hurt (knock on wood) but it just doesn&#039;t allow them a lot of wiggle room to troubleshoot if either of them are out for any reason. 

I am extremely excited for Minnesota hockey fans, though.  I adored the North Stars back in the olden days and this just warms my heart.  I&#039;m happy both guys got to go back home, so to speak, and even happier for their families.  Roots are powerful things.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[:) ahh I had to let that out, haha.  But you are right,we he loads of talent. And still have my favorite Henrique :)))!  But I wonder with Parise&#039;s, Suter&#039;s, and even Crosby&#039;s huge contract, if the league will do anything becuase it&#039;s circumventing the cap (appropraite term? huge brain freeze right now!)  They are similar to Kovy&#039;s contract not too long ago whih we got fined.

Is it October yet? :)!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We feel for you, Tiffany.  The Devils did as they said and really made a play to keep him.  Even after they narrowly avoided arbitration last season, NJ made him captain.  That shows a kind of faith and promise I doubt many teams would exercise.  We&#039;re sorry for you, but you still have loads of talent!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am so upset over this.  I&#039;m a Devils fan and it still hasn&#039;t hit me yet--even though I saw the Parise and Suter Wild jerseys for sale already.  HOW CAN YOU ZACH?!  You were the reason why I actually gave hockey a chance and went to a game with my brother. YOU!!  I get the fact that you want to be closer to your home and family, especially since you are getting married two weeks from Saturday.  But you are who you are because of the Devils.  WHAT ABOUT YOUR BROMANCE WITH TRAVIS!? :(

What I am more upset about how you basically led everyone on to thinking you will be resigning.  You kept using &quot;we&quot; and &quot;us&quot;.  You told fans &quot;don&#039;t worry&quot;. Now, you are just digging yourself in a deepr hole when you said &quot;I&#039;m loyal&quot; and &quot;no ties to No. 9&quot;.

I hate to say this, but be prepared to get booed when you return to the Rock on Nov 11.  And ironically, on 11/11, you will return with the number 11 back on your back.

Talk about pouring salt on an open wound from where the loss of the Cup left off.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gurrrrl, you know us so well! Seeing as Nasher is Deb&#039;s top gun and Silver is, like, my all-time fave, it would definitely be insanity. Our fan base is less jazzed about the idea of Rick, but Bobbo... quite the contrary. Bobby hails from Cherry Hill, NJ and his dad works for THE Bobby Clarke. Oh, and that cat he&#039;s petting... named after Pelle Lindbergh! It just makes sense to come home! (As always though, either player would be greatly appreciated in Washington!)]]></description>
