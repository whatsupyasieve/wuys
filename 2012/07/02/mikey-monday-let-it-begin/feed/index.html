		<description><![CDATA[LOVE the shot of him trying to extricate himself from Semin.  Awesome!

I know it would be devastating for you guys if he played for another team.  I could personally care less.  But I respect that he is unafraid to let his Freak Flag Fly.  And I confident that regardless of where he plays, he&#039;ll continue to be his freeky-deeky self and you will continue to love him and I will continue to personally care less.  He&#039;s not the type of player who will let a location define his career.  I love that and I honestly think that&#039;s the only way you can HAVE a career in this business the way it&#039;s set up right now.]]></description>
