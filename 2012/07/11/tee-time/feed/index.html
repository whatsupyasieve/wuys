		<description><![CDATA[9 more days until I see that glorious man in person :D Is there anything that he can&#039;t do and do absolutely perfect?!? And you&#039;re so right, behind that oh so serious exterior is a gorgeous man who has a boyish sense of humor, just look at how often he &quot;photo-bombs&quot; or rather &quot;interview-bombs&quot; his teammates since most of them are video. Exhibit A: http://video.blackhawks.nhl.com/videocenter/console?catid=690&#038;id=99714
Exhibit B(utt): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI-fKO4ZAP4
Exhibit C: http://video.blackhawks.nhl.com/videocenter/console?catid=690&#038;id=100499
Exhibit D: http://video.blackhawks.nhl.com/videocenter/console?catid=1106&#038;id=129187
And the most distracting interview ever: http://video.blackhawks.nhl.com/videocenter/console?catid=1111&#038;id=150850
It&#039;s sad that he can do this even when fully clothed, I&#039;m a lost cause.]]></description>
