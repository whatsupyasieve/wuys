		<description><![CDATA[HOW AM I ONLY JUST NOW SEEING THIS POST?!?!

That picture of the 2003 draft class? I AM DYING. Ryan is so obviously the one in the Mormon tie in the middle. And good god Ryan Getzlaf is a babe. His current hair loss is upsetting (he is three years YOUNGER than me!), but his FACE. That BONE STRUCTURE. B-A-B-E. Eternally jealous of his wife.

I only wish that EStaaaaaal and Jeff Carter were also in this picture. I would make it the wallpaper on every device I own.]]></description>
