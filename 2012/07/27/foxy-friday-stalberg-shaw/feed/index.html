		<description><![CDATA[All I can say is:  Hurray for everybody who attended being so diligent about documenting every millisecond of their Hawks Rock &#039;N Roll Fantasy.  It&#039;s hilarious and amazing and thank you very much.

Also - BIG kudos to the Hawks for continuing to host this event every summer.  Rain or shine.  CBA or no CBA.  Cup or no Cup.  Verbeauty or no Verbeauty.  It&#039;s obviously a huge hit and they players seem to enjoy it even more than the fans and that&#039;s saying a lot.  Competitor franchises should take notice, especially franchises that are having troubles.  What a great way to solidify (mack on?) your fanbase, and spread the word to folks who are fair-weather fans.]]></description>
