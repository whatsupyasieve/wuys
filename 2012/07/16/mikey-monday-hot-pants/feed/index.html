		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m starting to think the right hand work is drawn on.  Maybe CP (those are in fact his gf&#039;s initials) drew it?  It&#039;s very well done.  This is just me not liking tattoos in general, hoping otherwise.  Based on nothing. ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I will admit, I&#039;m cool with the sleeve (I actually really love a well-done sleeve tat), but I&#039;m less than enthused by the hand tattoo.   
I&#039;m also keeping my fingers crossed that he&#039;s just trying to negotiate to be rocking the red for longer than the one year they initially offered.  Don&#039;t let me down, Mikey.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Breathe, Pants. Remember how to breathe...

That hand tattoo must have hurt but he&#039;s a seasoned hockey player so it was probably child&#039;s play. Doesn&#039;t make the idea of a HAND TATTOO any better but... Look at that tan!  Focus on the tan and that black shirt! He&#039;s probably waiting for the Caps to offer some more of those black shirts in their contract. That&#039;s what I would do if i were GM GM.]]></description>
