		<description><![CDATA[Am I the only one that doesn&#039;t find this shoot sexy? What is the deal with the hockey players just lacking three years in a row? Now, Rob Gronkowski and Carlos Bocanegra? I&#039;d like a full issue devoted to this, please.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You have finally come to your senses.  I know it&#039;s tough to admit when somebody&#039;s an insufferable bore - especially when they&#039;re otherwise affable enough and nice to look at. 

But this is why looks WEAR AWFULLY THIN in due course.  What&#039;s the point of looking at somebody hot if they&#039;re just going to bore the crap out of you?  Just ask all his ex-girlfriends.  Something&#039;s not adding up.  He should be applying bug spray hourly to fend them off.  Yet he continues to have issues in that department.  I venture it&#039;s because he&#039;s boring.  Plain and simple.  It&#039;s a shame because he&#039;s got some dimension to him, he&#039;s deep and assuming he&#039;s not a wet blanket in the bedroom...  Well?  A good PEI boy.  Even the rich, famous and beautiful people can be flat-out boring.  It happens!

He should volunteer to be your intern this season.  Skinner can share, right?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good point, Brenda - it takes some spark to say yes to this whole thing.  We certainly don&#039;t want him to be like the old man from Family Guy or anything.  If he always sounds like he&#039;s reading the phone book, we can stick to photos and watching him score goals (since there are plenty of both).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you&#039;re being a little harsh.  He always sounds like that in his interviews.  Wouldn&#039;t it be weirder (and creepier) if he was giggling or something?  He just has a low voice.  Everyone can&#039;t be Biz Nasty.  Besides, anyone who&#039;s willing to take it all off for the camera can&#039;t be that boring, am I right?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chara, Kesler, Richards... They are improving, maybe one year they&#039;ll get it just right.

I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever seen Carlos Bocanegra WITH clothes. He is always naked for one reason or another. (PS - if you&#039;re looking for a soccer blog, may I suggest kickette. They are a little heavy on the sex and the city lifestyle aspiration, but they make up for it in pictures of Joe Hart in his underpants.)

I do not watch American football, but that one is the one they call &quot;Gronk&quot;, yes? I only know this from watching The Choice (judge me).

Finally, fencing. Who knew?!]]></description>
