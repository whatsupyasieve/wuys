		<description><![CDATA[Dawn, where are you for Fridays when we need you?  About 200 people have suggested Karlsson for Foxy Friday!  You&#039;re welcome to mention anyone - AT ALL - anytime.  Chuck&#039;s off at the Wizard World of Harry Potter and I can&#039;t do this thing by myself!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah, the Swedish connection! Both great d-men, and easy on the eyes, but interview-wise they&#039;re opposites, I&#039;ve heard Karlsson be very funny and lippy, but I think Edler is kinda shy and quiet.
I already have two teams to cheer for, but the way things are going, I may need more!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I feel so cougarish, but I think Erik is adorable and very, very talented.  I enjoyed watching him in interviews at the ASG and I was impressed with the way he handled himself and spoke very intelligently. Maybe a future Norris Trophy winner AFTER Kris Letang:P]]></description>
