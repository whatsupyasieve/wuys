		<description><![CDATA[As a Bruins fan, that was just brutal.  My son&#039;s squirt team is playing with more heart and they can be a bunch of slackers.

Gingeroux needs to lead the Bruins in a power play clinic the next time he is in town.  It would be better if they could just decline the penalty like they do in football.

50 goals!  That is just awesome anyway you look at it.  He looked so happy and he&#039;s adorable when he is happy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do we know if Chuck is OK? i was seriously concerned after her anguished tweets last night.  I was feeling her pain until, miracle of miracles, the Caps extracted their collective heads from their collective behinds and pulled out of the 4-1 deficit to win in the shootout. UNbelievable. Hendy is my fave grinder!]]></description>
