		<description><![CDATA[Last night was the literal definition of my love/hate relationship with the Blackhawks.

I turned the game off a after the Blues were up 3-1, only to turn it back on when David Backes (top of my sh*t list forever) crashed the goalie and I&#039;m all like &quot;Nobody beats up my boyfriend(s) and gets away with it, St. Louis!&quot; And of course I whooped and hollered at PKane&#039;s shootout goal and proceeded to dance to Chelsea Dagger alone in my living room. Zero shame.

Also for those concerned about Toews&#039; broken brain, you can meet Jess and I in 15 minutes when our prayer circle commences.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Really surprised that my neighbors didn&#039;t call in a noise voilation on me last night with all my screaming and cussing at the TV.  I knew the Caps had it in them to win, even when we were down by 3.  I think Locker wins this weeks quote-off with his description of Hendy&#039;s OT goal &quot;there&#039;s more moves there than a barrel of monkeys&quot;.  I 100% vote Neuvy as my &quot;foxy friday&quot; for turning around his goaltending recently and making some badass saves to keep the Caps afloat in the race for the playoffs.]]></description>
