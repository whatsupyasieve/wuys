		<description><![CDATA[Firing BB was a big mistake. BIG. HUGE! I have to go shopping now...

You don&#039;t allow players to have enough pull to get a coach fired... especially when that player (looking at you Ovechkin) isn&#039;t even playing well.  Someone needs to give him a dose of &quot;reality&quot; because clearly he&#039;s living in &quot;rockstar fantasy land&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[WHAT IS HAPPENING?! I think Dawn and I ran into each other yesterday and had a Freaky Friday exchange.  I&#039;ve been biting back the &quot;Trade this piece of s*%$&quot; comments all season (well, not from Gator) because I don&#039;t like Ovi anyway, and I&#039;m biased.  But when Dawn says it... well, who else has sweatpants with OVECHKIN across the ass?

I know how hard it is for Dawn to say this.  But she&#039;s right.  It&#039;s not the same as the Flyers trading Richie and Carts away for partying, but it&#039;s close.  If you don&#039;t care and you don&#039;t put the team first, you don&#039;t stay.  Ovi has saved himself marginally by delivering huge OT game winning goals (and for that we thank him), but it&#039;s not enough.  If he had his heart in the game, the Caps wouldn&#039;t have to win like that.

PS: He can take Sasha Fierce with him, I&#039;m sick of that jerk.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agreed. You know it&#039;s bad when Ovi is trying to steal the puck from his own player. The &quot;C&quot; has not been earned by Ovi. Totally agree that Brooks has deserved being captain. I&#039;ve thought that since 24/7 aired.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Let it out!, your totally right on the whole issue. Every time I watch a Capitals game he is always acting like a 2 year old instead of a 26 year old, can&#039;t shot worth shit anymore, he doesn&#039;t deserve to be captain. Give it to someone that works his ass off for the team and is a team player. That needs to stop or he&#039;s going to lose every single fan he has. And possibly his job too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you. I love Ovi but someone with more clout needed to sit him down and say, &quot;Kid, you&#039;re good but you&#039;re not THAT good and here&#039;s the deal, pull it together or go back to Russia because that attitude doesn&#039;t fly here no matter how much money is on the table. Or we&#039;ll trade you to a shithole team if you have such a huge problem with Boudreau. Now hand over that &quot;C&quot; because Brooks Liach already has his needle threaded. :) I think they would have been in a better play off position. But unfornately, there is no wayback machine.]]></description>
