		<description><![CDATA[I always have a soft spot for my Nordiques - sorry, Avalanche - and it would be heartwarming to see them squeak into the playoffs this year.  They&#039;re a fun group of bright-eyed youngsters nobody expected would do jack shit this year.  And Skog has become the runaway fave for the Calder since my Bob Smith kinda fumed out a few months back...

Yay and yay.  But if their locker room suddenly becomes ground zero for a flu infestation (because he IS contagious - and I&#039;m not talking about his enthusiasm) then I&#039;ll be cursing like a sailor without his grog oh yes indeed...  They need to burn anything they think he might have touched.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Henrique is having a great year for the Devils, especially with all of their injury troubles, he has stepped right in seamlessly. I am kind of shocked at how mature both of these boys play. Also, sucks for RNH that his injuries have really limited his game time, otherwise he was running away with it.]]></description>
