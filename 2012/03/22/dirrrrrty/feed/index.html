		<description><![CDATA[Like the Sedins a little better after Henrik&#039;s post game comments: I&#039;m a Leafs fan and don&#039;t care either way.
This is what Henrik said:
“It’s one of those hits where things were said before from a certain guy and he did what he wanted to and that’s too bad,” said Henrik, who is a few minutes older than his twin brother. “But again, they are tough team over there and we’re the diving bunch so I guess there’s not much to say about that.” (from the National Post)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It was a dumb hit, but the Canucks are just lucky that suspensions don&#039;t get handed out for:

Hair-pulling
Finger-biting
Fish-hooking
Diving, diving, so much diving (wait, can that be a suspension? Is this soccer? I&#039;m confused.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love my Blackhawks, but this is a true case of two wrongs don&#039;t make a right. Sedin definitely put his shoulder up to his Keith&#039;s head. That said, Keith should have kept a cool head and let it slide, but no. Keith went after Sedin. He can say he didn&#039;t until he&#039;s blue in the face but he did go after Sedin. The difference between the two hits.....Keith went after Sedin with intention to REALLY go after his head.

The thing that ticks me off most is that the Hawks are winning and they need their former Norris trophy winning defenseman on the ice rather than taking a suspension. Duncan Keith will definitely be Shanabanned.]]></description>
