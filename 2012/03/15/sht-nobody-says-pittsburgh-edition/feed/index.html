		<description><![CDATA[I am a Penguins fan, and I&#039;ve been a Penguin since I was 6. But I agree with you completely, they really do not need Crosby be right now! They have Malkin, Neal, Kunitz line that is the best in the league!!! And they are like a match made in heaven, lol. Also, I don&#039;t want him to get injured.... Again. Something else I really didn&#039;t like, was the fact that the announcers before the game started were all over Crosby and completely forgot about Kris Letang coming back! And same thing happened during the game, they didn&#039;t even mention Letang until the 3rd period!!! I mean, what are they attached at the hip of Crosby? There are other players too, that deserve to be talked about. I love the team, but not how everybody in the NHL kisses Crosby&#039;s behind.

Sorry if I offended anyone. Didn&#039;t mean too.

P.S. Is the dog in the picture with Kris Letang, is that really his dog? If so, they make a cute couple!]]></description>
