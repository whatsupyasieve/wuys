Also - has there been a Foxy Friday from the Jets? I maintain my slow-news-day submission of Evander Kane.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[True fact! My goal in science was to make puppies and kittens remain puppies and kittens and not turn into dogs and cats. That was before I got old and started doing science for reals. However, should Nick Lidstrom decide to donate himself to the cause, I heartily volunteer to study him. And hey, I already have a head start seeing as I saw him in all his DILF glory every day at the pool in Vegas last year (I will never stop telling this story, bee tee dubs). Of all the players I saw, he had the best beach body, hands down, up and all over.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My favorite hockey-related commercial!  Low-key and endearing.  Lidstrom is an excellent Foxy Friday choice!

For the Stars, well, Burish is the most entertaining?  And Cal Clutterbuck of the Wild kinda looks like a silent movie star when he&#039;s trying.  Plus his name is the basically the greatest.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After retiring from the NHL Lidstrom needs to take up a career in science (I&#039;m looking at you, Jess) - whatever he&#039;s doing to prevent ageing like other mere mortals needs to be studied in a lab. Without his shirt on like the photos above demonstrate.

This is also the final straw - I&#039;m officially moving to Sweden. Of buying a lifetime supply of Swedish water. Good lord.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for finally having a Red Wing picked for Foxy Friday. You couldn&#039;t have picked a better Detroit player for the honor. Lidstrom is not only an amazing player but a wonderful man. He is a role model and hero to a lot of people in Hockeytown. I can only hope and pray my husband is still playing some sort of hockey at 41.... and looks THAT good. Yummy!]]></description>
