		<description><![CDATA[I think they&#039;ll be careful now.  Obviously I want him back yesterday, but after what continues to go on with Crosby, if Toews misses the rest of this season then so be it.  But I doubt he will.  Plenty of guys have gone out with concussions this season and come back fine (says Intern Jeff Skinner from the background).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Between this, Lepretty AND Toews being out, I don&#039;t have enough anxiety medication to handle today.

It was bad enough when Stalberg got cut on the neck and a beat reporter described it as: &quot;Plenty of blood on Stalberg&#039;s jersey around the neck. Looks like a vampire who just had a field day. Leaving #Blackhawks bench for stitches.&quot; GROSS.

I guess there&#039;s nothing else to say but get well soon, Viktor. Someone as pretty as you belongs on the ice.]]></description>
