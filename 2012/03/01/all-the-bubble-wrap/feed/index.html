		<description><![CDATA[Nice blog, Eunice!  Can&#039;t wait to see what you&#039;ve got coming in the furute!  The Sharks are an awesome team with a fan base that may be smaller than any other Bay Area sport but the people that support the Sharks are more loyal and hardcore than any other fans out there.  With the exception of my Giants loyalty!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was sick from a stomach flu when I was watching this game, but I just about puked when Tanger hit the ice like that and immediately went to the locker room! The commentators (on fricking NBC, whom I HATE!) were arguing back &#038; forth over whether or not Nystrom was in the wrong because he used his shoulder, etc. IMO, I don&#039;t care WHAT part of his body he hit Tanger with, he deliberately ignored the puck &#038; played the player - to ME, that should be suspendable!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I say suspend him, because no matter if it was the elbow or shoulder its a hit to the head which is what the NHL is trying to get rid of! Not to mention the fact that he wasn&#039;t even trying to go for the puck, if he did then he would have never hit Letang in the first place.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I told Lindsay I didn&#039;t think I wanted to watch the video and I just watched the video anyways and got teary-eyed. I hate it when players lay on the ice like that. It makes even a hardcore bitch like me get teary-eyed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had gone to the kitchen for TWO SECONDS only to come back out just in time to see this happen. My stomach dropped. I could have thrown a shoe at Nystrom, luckily Engelland beat me to it and in a much more convincing display. His beautiful, beauitful face. It&#039;s been through hell this season]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pants, I think you know where I stand on this argument.
And if Shanaban doesn&#039;t take action I have no problem hiring someone to fix the situation...
He has risen to the TOP of my shit list. And it&#039;s not a place anyone wants to be.

I personally want to take fault for that lasts situation. I must have accidentally jinxed my man by finding a way around paying $300 for an authentic jersey. I paid $75 and it arrived yesterday morning. This is obviously the Hockey Gods punishing me for cheating the system. Apologies.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, were you eavesdropping on my texting convo with Carter last night? Her exact words: &quot;PUT EVERYONE ON THE PENS IN BUBBLE WRAP&quot; and &quot;Everyone buy stock in bubble wrap!&quot;

Personally, I think it&#039;s suspend-able. You don&#039;t get to hit the pretty players in the head and break their brains without being held accountable.

Eric Nystrom - you, along with David Steckel, Victor Hedman, David Krejčí, Rene Bourke and whoever concussed Jonathan Toews (I&#039;m looking at you, Joe Thornton), are the latest on my sh*t list.]]></description>
