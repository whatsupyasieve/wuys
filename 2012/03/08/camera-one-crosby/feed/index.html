		<description><![CDATA[Eeeeeeeee! This post made my day. I&#039;m going to be in Miami on Sunday, but if Crosby&#039;s playing, I&#039;m staying inside and watching the game.
So much anticipation!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason Bourne Crosby?! I just died a little.
Also, when Sid says things like &quot;My conditioning&#039;s as good as it&#039;s gonna get&quot; I feel a little dizzy.
I could only sit through a few minutes of this interview because Pierre is SO ANNOYING but noticed - are they green screened in front of those Penguins jerserys?? WTF.

Finally - I am going to be in Pittsburgh for the Pens&#039; March 25 game. If Crosby is back I may cry actual tears at seeing the Prince of Canada play in person.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While I 100% appreciate Sid&#039;s hockey skills and think he is pretty darn cute and can&#039;t wait for him to make a triumphant return, I am not a Crosby fangirl. He doesn&#039;t make my cry the tears. That being said, the thought of &quot;Jason Bourne&quot; Crosby has just MELTED by brain. *faints*]]></description>
