		<description><![CDATA[I. Love. You.
I was going to have to wait a WHOLE TWO MONTHS until I got home so I could watch the episode on my DVR.
&quot;You want to see the whole thing?&quot;
Is that a question? Don&#039;t tease me!
Oh my gosh, you guys at WUYS just work magic.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Even though I am Canadian and have to wait a week to watch this in non-HD, I can already tell it&#039;s going to be solid gold. NHL36 has really hit their stride and made these super entertaining. I think Patrick Kane should get a do-over (see what I did there? Everything is Blackhawks to me.) There is no way he is that dull. Either the editors dropped the ball or his creepy, spherical dad has Svengalied him to the point where we should all be concerned. Free PKane t-shirts, anyone?

PS - I totally respect James Neal&#039;s endeavours to keep his hair. I find hair loss in young men (I&#039;m looking at you Tazer) and myself (following traumatic salon visit) deeply, deeply upsetting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agreed with Sue 1000%!!! Not NEARLY enough of the Real Deal!!! And I WANNA KNOW WHO DID THE BOTTLES - FOR SURE!!! Cookie was grinning like he knew who did it, even though he said he knew nothing. What do ya&#039;ll think? Was it Duper or Cookie? The HELL with little brother - I&#039;ll be his cougar! *lmao* And let&#039;s not forget that he bought dinner for his family &#038; friends! Yes, in my world, if you&#039;d just signed a $30 million deal, you&#039;d be expected to, but we all know that the sports world doesn&#039;t always work like that. It was nice to see that his dad offered to pay &#038; Nealer wouldn&#039;t let him. Also, the laughter about the garage doors he damaged &#038; his mama making him breakfast were great!!! Definitely ratings GOLD! Only problem now is that everyone will know how spectacular our Nealer is!]]></description>

Pluses all around:  totally love that James Neal is stylish, but not in the hipster wannabe way (rocking plaid and diagonal stripes is not easy), the hair, the bad soccer playing, the water bottles attached to his bumper....all ratings gold.]]></description>
