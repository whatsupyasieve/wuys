		<description><![CDATA[This game, and this goal, almost killed me. I witnessed my favourite ginger in the league score the prettiest goal ever while simultaneously sinking my beloved Leafs and our playoff chances. It&#039;s a wonder I&#039;m still here...Claude, please stop making me love you! I don&#039;t think I can take anymore!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m just sitting here like a proud Mama Hen, mixing up a new batch of kool-aid for you all

Next, we&#039;ll have you fawning over Danny&#039;s soft spoken French Canadian-ness (maybe not, you&#039;ve already got Letang) or admiring Hartnell&#039;s inane ability to fall down in the process of scoring 60% of his goals.

Max, bless his heart, wears neon orange pants to autograph signings in Philly...I wouldn&#039;t bank on him to be Ginger Jesus&#039; fashion savoir]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am blaming Canada for this clothing foul (it is the only explanation I can come up wtih)....  I have a possible upcoming work trip to Toronto and I am afraid for my eyes.  I can only hope if I do run in to some plaid-on-plaid-on-plaid it is someone as attractive as the NHL&#039;ers we know and love who choose to celebrate this fashion faux-pas]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Whimper! I miss Max. I almost forgot how much till I watched the Flyers warm-up in DC last weekend.  His hair&#039;s all long and rogue-ish too, like he knows.  Talbot has a career-high 18 goals this season! If he breaks 20 I will dance.  I hated to see him go orange but at least he&#039;s succeeding there.  Now, if Giroux can teach him to score goals maybe Max can intervene in the &quot;all-plaid, all-the-time&quot; department.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YOU PLAY WITH MAX TALBOT. What are you WEARING, Gingeroux??
I&#039;m fully hydrated thanks to the KoolAid you&#039;ve been doling out (give in, Chuck!) but this is almost too much.
It&#039;s a good thing he&#039;s so dammed good at hockey, &#039;cuz otherwise this insipid affair would be over.]]></description>
