		<description><![CDATA[I feel your pain Pants. The Hawks long and winding road trip was like a dagger to the heart. Then Captain Serious is out with a concussion. I swear, if Sharpie or Kaner goes down I will seriously start crying in my Wheaties.

I watched the game last night and the first two periods were painful. There was a bit of redemption in the the third, but it was a little too late. If there was anything positive at all was the fact that I got to see Troy Brouwer without a helmet. Kinda foxy.]]></description>

Speaking of bad relationships, the Pens &#038; Bruins (hell, even the Hawks) aren&#039;t much better. I feel you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If they bring the Zach Parise show to town again, it is.  But I can&#039;t believe that they&#039;d do that to you, Linds.  Not after you&#039;ve given in to loving them.

PS: Good for ZP, driving up his UFA price for the off-season.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, Pants. They so are. The emotional rollercoaster that is being a Caps fan is starting to take its toll. Josie &#038; I were exhausted by the 3rd minute of the 1st period just trying to keep up with the annoying Flyers chants and urging our boys along. We sat motionless for a good minute after the game had ended. We promised that we&#039;d stay away from the Verizon Center for a good week before even looking to go to a practice or game.

But you all know better, we&#039;re going to be there whether they show up or not. We&#039;re in too deep now. :&#039;(]]></description>
