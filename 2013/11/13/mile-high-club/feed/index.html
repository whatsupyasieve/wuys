		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a link to some great off-ice Blackhawks pics: Patrick Dempsey (er, Sharp) and a surprisingly sexy Patrick Kane modeling clothes in a magazine article. There&#039;s a video link part way down for behind the scenes footage of the photo shoot. And a link at the bottom to a similar article featuring Jonathan Toews from three years ago.

We have a new team member this year, Michael Kostka, who looks like Chad Helmsworth. And in fact dressed as Thor for Halloween:  https://twitter.com/Kostka85/status/395661412497776640/photo/1
https://twitter.com/Bollig87/status/391280981694369792

Movember mustache growing progress reports: http://blackhawks.nhl.com/club/blogpost.htm?id=22642

In the very, very funny category, here&#039;s Brandon Bollig&#039;s version of the Patrick Kane stick-handling video : http://video.blackhawks.nhl.com/videocenter/console?catid=894&#038;id=446251&#038;lang=en&#038;navid=DL&#124;CHI&#124;home

The Kane version for those who haven&#039;t seen it: http://blackhawks.nhl.com/club/blogpost.htm?id=20223

This is a commercial for a bank that sponsors the Hawks, but it&#039;s totally worth seeing if only for the ten seconds of Kane and Shaw swimming laps in uniform, including helmets and skates:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFFQwam3s5s&#038;list=UUCxWx_ivtsmrga6iqcEQxsg

Many Hawks looking hot in suits in this video from the Hawks&#039; &quot;Mom&#039;sTrip&quot; (they brought their moms with them on a two game road trip to Florida): http://video.blackhawks.nhl.com/videocenter/console?catid=894&#038;id=477000&#038;lang=en&#038;navid=DL&#124;CHI&#124;home

More Hawks looking sexy in suits while arriving for the first home game of the season:

The biggest news this season may be all the little &#039;Hawks born the past six months: Sadie Sharp, Carter Seven Seabrook, Colton Keith, and Zoja Hossa born just yesterday
Photo of Seabs with Carter: http://blackhawks.nhl.com/club/blogpost.htm?id=19650

Also, I can&#039;t remember if you&#039;ve written about the blog &quot;My Little Blackhawk&quot; before, but it not, it&#039;s pretty funny. All your favorite hockey players drawn as ponies.  It used to be exclusively Blackhawks, starting with Uni-Kane, but now she does a herd from other teams about once a week.  Aside from the unbearable cuteness of it all, she does some pretty cool drawings replicating real-life hockey photos. See Aug 31, July 10, July 14, July 27, for some photo/video reenactments. See Oct 16, Sept 30, Sept 13, Sept 2, July 11 and July 7 for general cuteness.

(Capitals fans should see the posts on Sept 18 and 21. Bruins Aug 22)

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with you, Laura.  Sadly, hockey and sports in general, are no better than the rest of the population on this issue, and to call it shameful really doesn&#039;t begin to cover it.  The chants of &quot;beat your wife, Potvin&quot; at the Garden make the capillaries in my eyes twitch with rage.

Wrap Around Curl is one of my favorite hockey fans online (who also shares my love of nail polish), and she posted this last week: http://wraparoundcurl.wordpress.com/2013/11/09/i-dont-care-about-your-mustache-unless-it-is-to-fight-domestic-violence/]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the link, that&#039;s a really good article. Really, really depressing, but good. It&#039;s good to see someone covering the issue and pointing out how awful and problematic the NHL&#039;s response has been. Ugh. They&#039;re showing athletes in specific what they safely get away with doing to the women in their lives - but also abusers in general, and with no evidence condemning the alleged victim as a false accuser, which is also sending a really dangerous message.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am... really disgusted and saddened by the total lack of acknowledgement, from team or players, that the charges - whether accurate or not - are extremely serious. Innocent until proven guilty is a very important part of our legal system, but it doesn&#039;t mean that people have to pretend there&#039;s no chance someone accused of a crime actually did that crime. But that&#039;s what the Avs are doing - right from the start, just moved forwards as if nothing was going on, as if there was no chance that any of the players would have a problem sharing a locker room with someone who MIGHT have beaten his girlfriend repeatedly. (MIGHT - we don&#039;t know, but there&#039;s absolutely a chance that the allegations are true.)

I&#039;m a new hockey fan and when I&#039;d heard stories/rumors that various hockey heroes (Bobby Hull, for example) committed acts of domestic violence, I assumed that they were just that - rumors. That there weren&#039;t real charges or any sort of serious allegations. It turns out I was totally wrong. The hockey world is just completely willing to shrug off violence against women, to treat any consequences that result from that violence as &quot;character building&quot; for the player. And they do this while upholding the myth that hockey is full of &quot;high character&quot;, nice, small-town boys and that hockey players are so much better than athletes in other sports.

Sorry, I know this isn&#039;t really the place for this rant, I&#039;m just... I can&#039;t stop thinking about it and I&#039;m really upset.]]></description>
