		<description><![CDATA[There are idiots at every game. Like that bitch who dumped beer on Pardy&#039;s head at  the Hawks game tonight.
I&#039;m already dreading the day Parise comes back to Jersey, I know the fans are going to boo him relentlessly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, Seguin&#039;s comments afterwards about not going back to Boston because he wants to play where he&#039;s wanted were so sad. I am glad the Stars managed a win so full of irony though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why was it nearly impossible to find this game on the NHL network last night?  There were tons of live look-ins at other games, but THIS was the game that I really wanted to see.

So, so, so happy to see Seguin &#038; Peverley score in the shootout.  And not just because the Bruins lost, but because there was no reason for the Bruins to make such a big deal about Seguin&#039;s shenanigans.  Chiarelli could have made it about their depth at center, their need for a wing or the cap, but he made it personal. Hey, Peter, maybe if you&#039;d spent less time complaining about Seguin and more time trying to mentor him, you would have liked the results. Could I introduce you to former &#039;franchise ruining party boy&#039; and current 2-time Cup champion and Conn Smythe winner, Patrick Kane? 

Now I&#039;m off to watch those highlights again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a stars fan I can say we appreciated having both Seguin and Peverley on the team.

Here&#039;s a gifset of Seguin wearing a Cowboy hat http://beauttbennett.tumblr.com/post/63808366400/cowboy-seguin
