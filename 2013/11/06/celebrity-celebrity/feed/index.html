		<description><![CDATA[I too found it interesting that so many guys like Jennifer Aniston.  JVR had an interview with Cabbie and he too chose Aniston and Rachel MacAdams.  I am quite surprised nobody said Scarlett Johansson.  She&#039;s totally hot!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This was my favourite thing of all yesterday! I am both happy and sad that no Blackhawks were featured.

My absolute favourite moment was Tuukka picking Beyonce closely followed by Backes picking Anna Kendrick. What? No Emma Stone or Jennifer Lawrence? Hockey players: their girl crushes are just like ours!

And while delighted by their seemingly ubiquitous desire to be cougared, all the Aniston responses smack of &quot;DON&#039;T ALIENATE THE TWEENS!&quot;. Taylor and Logan did not get this memo.]]></description>

Love seeing some of them (looking at you, Cammalleri) blush over this.

		<description><![CDATA[I feel heartened that quite a few of them said older women, given Jennifer Aniston&#039;s age and Rachel McAdams as well. :) Also, Beyonce. Tuuka, you are the goalie of my heart (when that space is not being overtaken by Corey Crawford feels, at least, or Kari Lehtonen).]]></description>
