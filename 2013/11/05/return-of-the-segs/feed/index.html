		<description><![CDATA[I was there too...Could not believe all the taunting and boos!!!!!! It was like he asked for the trade-definitely reminded me of Kessel. I kept saying that he was going to score at some point because of it. My friend and I were quietly clapping during his shootout goal. And then when people booed Pevs I was so sad. It was like they forgot about him until the shootout. And leave it to the former Bruins to be the ones to score in the shootout anyway!
If anyone boos Ference (which I just can&#039;t see happening) when the Oilers come to town I&#039;m going to flip...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m finally over the shock of the trade. I can even name you some Dallas Stars players other than Benn and Peverley. But I so miss the Segs-Bergy-Marchy line. 

In one of Segs&#039; interviews I just saw yesterday, he mentioned he was having dinner with Marchy last night. Man. I would&#039;ve LOVED to have been a fly on the wall during THAT dinner!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have had this date memorized since the schedule came out. The hockey part of me understands why the trade happened, but the fangirl part of me misses that damn smile. Tonight will definitely be bittersweet!]]></description>
