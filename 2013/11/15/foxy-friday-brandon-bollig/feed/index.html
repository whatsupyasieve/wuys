		<description><![CDATA[My apologies. I only started reading this blog in the Spring of 2013 when I was introduced to it through your Puck Daddy Beard Watch posts.  There was a fair amount of Blackhawks coverage then, but I thought (wrongly) that it was due to the playoffs after a pretty heavy does of all things Crosby over the summer.

I hope you had a great time while here in Chicago.

Go Hawks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pat, you&#039;ve found us out... but only for something that at least I have been readily admitting to for years.  The Blackhawks are my Western Conf team, Chuck only shudders because of last year&#039;s Cup final and we even ditched our friends on an October trip to Chicago to go to a Hawks game.  You can enjoy all 131 pieces of evidence that this is not new, but a long-standing weakness for the Hawks around here: http://wuys.wpengine.com/tag/chicago-blackhawks/.  In fact - are the Hawks the most-Foxy Friday&#039;s team in history?  They may be.]]></description>

They kindly obliged us the answer, and then we had even more fun watching everyone else desperately searching for the answer on twitter as #wheresbollig made it to the top of the Chicago trending list.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[FINALLY! :) I&#039;ve loved Bollig for ages and couldn&#039;t have been happier when he RTd a post of mine back in February.
https://twitter.com/jstefanc/status/301336348051271681/photo/1

Follow him on Twitter. Good looks, a great 4th liner, and a fun self-deprecating sense of humor (see his &quot;agent&quot; video above)!!

And if you haven&#039;t already read the article--or, let&#039;s be honest, checked out the pictures--do!
