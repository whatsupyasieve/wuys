		<description><![CDATA[as a devils fan, i don&#039;t have any real change to deal with, other than a few new teams, which is probably why i&#039;m mostly indifferent to the whole thing.

the unevenness doesn&#039;t bother me that much, i think there was a period of about 10 years or so when the patrick division had 6 teams while the other 3 divisions had 5 teams. and there will be an even number of teams in each division soon enough anyway.

sentimentally i would like it if they used the old division names again. it would be awesome to one day see a new &quot;patrick division champions&quot; banner go to the rafters at prudential. whats old is new. (but i doubt they&#039;ll actually &quot;name&quot; the divisions anyway.)

i guess after putting up with the lockouts, i don&#039;t care as much about how the league is set up, as long as the boys are playing!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This realignment is entitled: How to Make the Penguins/Capitals Rivalry Real.  I like it in a sick, twisted and self-abusing way.  It would put the teams I love (Pens/Caps) and the teams I love to hate (Rangers/Flyers) all together and probably kill me.

This deal also swaps me a Tavares for a Stamkos, which isn&#039;t quite my asking price but it&#039;s over the minimum bid I&#039;d set on eBay.

Mostly I just want a whole season where we play teams from other conferences.

Has someone put the Maple Leafs on suicide watch?  Not only is TO probably going to get another team some time in the near future but now they have the Red Wings in their conference?!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe I&#039;m indifferent in that I&#039;m so confused? Gawd, everytime the analysts start into the math (and not the good kind, as in &quot;Half your age plus 7&quot;), like how many times teams will play, and how the playoffs will work...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. All I want to know is:

- How many times can I see the Blackhawks?
- Will I see the Canucks less? (then yes PLEASE!)
- Can the Ranges PLEASE get out of the Pens conference?

That&#039;s about it. I&#039;ll get y&#039;all to explain it to me when it&#039;s all said and done. Love you girls!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sort of indifferent over it, although I do think it&#039;s kind of lame that 1) TB and Florida get screwed on the extra commute and 2) we lose the Chicago/Detroit rivalry. I&#039;m more interested in the gossip over what they would name the new conferences - my bet is if they go with &quot;people who&#039;ve had a great impact in NHL history&quot; then Bettman will put in one with his name.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hate, hate, hate.  Uneven conferences equals unequal chances at a playoff spot and that&#039;s the whole point of a season.  Wait until expansion is finalized (because we know it&#039;s coming) and for the Phoenix clusterF to be settled (hahahahaha) and THEN tackle realignment.  For now, swap Nashville and Winnipeg and be done with it.  Why does the NHL insist on making everything so difficult?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think everyone is in agreement that at some point in the next couple years there are probably going to be teams in Quebec City and the Toronto metro-area, whether through expansion or by moving a franchise. That would add another two teams to the already lopsided Eastern conference.

With that in mind, wouldn&#039;t it be more helpful to table this conversation for another year? In the meantime, do the logical thing and swap Columbus and Winnipeg for next season. Helps on the travel and hopefully a fresh start for both franchises.]]></description>
