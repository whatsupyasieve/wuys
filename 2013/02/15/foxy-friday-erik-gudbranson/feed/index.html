		<description><![CDATA[So how do we get to meet him?!?  He is gorgeous! I&#039;m single and 20...so I think we&#039;re a perfect match! lol    And I love that he does charity work and gives to the cancer foundations I think it&#039;s a great way to give back.  I actually donate my hair for wigs for cancer patients and I know I feel great being able to give even just a little so I can only imagine how he must feel giving to the foundation that saved his brothers life, so incredible!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I saw him last weekend. He is an ACTUAL real life Prince Eric (or Prince Erik as Jess and I refer to him as). 
It disappoints me that he doesn&#039;t wear a visor. I don&#039;t care if he&#039;s a D-man and they tend to not wear visors. 
Protect that face!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[SO MANY COMMENTS! And my bosses aren&#039;t here this morning so I will share all of them.

I too had forgotten about Hot Erik. I mean, I kept seeing pictures of him playing bridesmaid to the love fest that was Hall/Seguin, but I think he was broken and didn&#039;t even play for much of the 2010/2011 season? Either that, or just... Florida Panthers, right?

He was always liminal to my hockey hot boy radar, and last week I think it was, he tweeted that he was making an appearance on some show called &quot;Hit the Ice&quot; on APTN in Canada (Aboriginal Peoples&#039; Television Network... buried deep in the channels that everyone gets but no one watches), so I was like &quot;I&#039;ll PVR that, see what the deal is.&quot; The deal was HE IS SO OUTRAGEOUSLY HOT I ACTUALLY SQUEALED AND FELL OF MY COUCH. HE IS A REAL LIFE DISNEY PRINCE. As much as we like to say that Taylor and Tyler are not the children they chronologically are, THIS ONE. THIS HOT ERIK. THIS IS NOT A CHILD. HE IS SO TALL AND SO HANDSOME. I am going out on a limb and declaring that he is Handsome Years Old. Sharp, Lundqvist, Hamm, and now Gudbranson. This is good company to keep.

And, as I am a good Canadian friend to y&#039;all. I have found a preview his episode of Hit The Ice on the internets: http://www.hittheice.tv/  (Episode 5). The part where he&#039;s all &quot;You&#039;re not lazy but you can look it&quot;... he followed that by saying to be a good defensemen you have to be an asshole and &quot;That&#039;s how I got where I am. I&#039;m a prick.&quot; I may have recorded that whole part of the TV with my phone for posterity...

		<description><![CDATA[I will take the blame for nominating him! Although it wouldn&#039;t surprise me if I was not the only one. I mean, hello.

I&#039;d also like to take a moment to recognize the 2010 Draft Class of Doom for cursing me with terrible cougar-like tendencies. I won&#039;t list off the other boys from that draft because that would just be creepy. But one of them just got called up to the Penguins this week and he&#039;s a delight on Twitter. That&#039;s all I&#039;ll say :)]]></description>
