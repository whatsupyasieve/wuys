		<description><![CDATA[Anemia is the most common disorder of the blood. The several kinds of anemia are produced by a variety of underlying causes. It can be classified in a variety of ways, based on the morphology of RBCs, underlying etiologic mechanisms, and discernible clinical spectra, to mention a few. The three main classes include excessive blood loss (acutely such as a hemorrhage or chronically through low-volume loss), excessive blood cell destruction (hemolysis) or deficient red blood cell production (ineffective hematopoiesis).&quot;,-,

		<description><![CDATA[hahaha thanks for the screencap! You know I&#039;m right. If I could scoot my boot down there for tonight I&#039;d be there with orange and black bells and whistles! (while wearing my Greenie ASG shirt underneath) I&#039;m ashamed to say despite the Caps &quot;whoomp whoooomp&quot; start of a season, the Flyers are not much better. They will either take over the Verizon Center or crash miserably. There seems to almost be no middle ground.

And ok, I know you don&#039;t want the Flyers to hug, but you know you want a Brioux hug. Even if it&#039;s just a, &quot;hey, baby, you did really well on dat shift.&quot; Either way, I&#039;ll be crying tonight.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ha! As IF you&#039;ll be cheering for the Caps tonight, Pants! When Danny and Giroux are together, it&#039;s like kryptonite. What were you saying the other night about high heels?
Make sure you wear some tonight to the game. :)]]></description>
