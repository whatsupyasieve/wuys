		<description><![CDATA[That locker room looks like something out of a James Bond or X-Men movie. Some super secret lair where they train assasins or kids with mutant powers.  I keep waiting for Patrick Stewart to roll out of the shadows and say something wizen and profound.

Love Dutchie, he of perpetually rosy cheeks.  My cheeks get like that, especially after a few glass of wine.

I can&#039;t do a burpee...but I kind of want to just to say I did one.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh Max.....so....French. I still haven&#039;t forgiven you for your transgressions, er, going to the Flyers. WHY COULDN&#039;T IT HAVE BEEN ANY OTHER TEAM??

I know it&#039;s better for him there blah blah blah - but I miss you Max. I do. Sad panda is sad. I guess I&#039;ll just have to come visit you in Philly and pretend to like the Flyers. Which isn&#039;t feeling so challenging anymore. Thanks to Pants. It&#039;s all her fault.]]></description>
