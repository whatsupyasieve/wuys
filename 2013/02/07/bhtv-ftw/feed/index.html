		<description><![CDATA[The only way the video could have possibly been better is if it was just 2 straight minutes of JT doing squats in nothing but spandex shorts. Alas, BHTV has to be fair to all the other media departments and limit their videos of Toews squatting by disguising them as &quot;resistance band training&quot; and &quot;Football, Fitness, and Fun&quot;. Seriously though, whoever runs the BH media department better be on the same pay scale as Toews and Kane. That person is a Hawks treasure.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This video convinced my roommate that Jonathan Toews has THE best ass on the planet. And made her want to drive 5 hours from Columbus to a Hawks game in Chicago in April with me. She actually has a countdown to when we leave and she can see his ass in all of its glory.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I only watched this video once. Just once. And I swear I never paused it when Toews was catching that football or when Carcillo was doing something with that towel or the push-ups or even during the interview with Sharp--with his shirt on!--so I could adequately admire his dark, perfectly messy hair.

Yep. Just watched it once. I&#039;m sticking to that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jess texted me this morning saying &quot;I have a hangover from that video.&quot; It&#039;s like it was a dream and I couldn&#039;t believe it was real. 

And who titles that video &quot;Football, Fitness and Fun&quot;? Fun?? How about FLAILING? FANGIRLING? All profanity beginning with F???

You know Jess and I are all about the JToews but seriously...Tumblr practically exploded after this. There&#039;s so many gifs that I can&#039;t tell WHOSE chests are whose. And let&#039;s be clear - it doesn&#039;t even matter.]]></description>
