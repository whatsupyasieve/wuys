		<description><![CDATA[Dear Mr Blue Blue Eyes; Please take Mike aside and run your clippers over his head. It&#039;s time.

And can he shave, because, like srsly, I think we&#039;re all over the Sasquatch look here. And only MAX TALBOT can carry it off....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Man, I feel bad for him (and for the team).  No one wants to see a good player always being plagued by injuries.  It&#039;s such a shame.  

However, even though I feel for him and think he is beautiful, I cannot go against my Devils, so I am kind of hoping he stays out for this series.  I believe he is the reason we went into overtime back in Jan?  Especially since the Devils are not playing like they want to play!!!!

Speedy recovery to Mike.  But it won&#039;t hurt if you rest your bod for two more games :D.  Excited to see Oates again!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The least brown banana&quot; may be the funniest comparison I have ever heard! I am totally stealing it :D
But really, can he cut the hair soon? I would rather have short hair with well kept beard than long hair/no beard. Short hair/no beard would be best but I am afraid that it is asking to much at this point. He does own a VW bus now. Gotta keep that vagrant look to match the bus. I would rather he matched the sleek, black mercedes I saw him arrive at Kettler in, once upon a time. Oh well, getter better soon, Greenie. Your boys need you!]]></description>
