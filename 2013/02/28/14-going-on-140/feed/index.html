		<description><![CDATA[Overall I agree with Kaitlin and she said it pretty much perfectly, so I&#039;ll just say &quot;ditto&quot; to that.  And as a Ranger fan, this puts me in the odd situation of a long distance high five with a Flyers fan.  ;)

There is a piece of me, though, that is so starved for personality in the NHL that I&#039;m kind of willing to let it slide.  &quot;We&#039;re taking it one shift at a time, one game at a time.&quot;  &quot;Keeping it simple and playing our game.&quot;  &quot;They&#039;re always a tough team to play against.&quot;  ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ  

Yeah, the Kings&#039; feed and some players&#039; feeds have crossed the line from time to time, but the overall entertainment value outweighs it for me.  Also, if fans can directly chirp the players on Twitter, I think the players should be able to chirp back -- as long as they&#039;re willing to deal with the fallout.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think your comment that this is the Kings as opposed to another NHL organization was spot on. They&#039;re a team with a smaller and less entrenched fan base, so they can, sort of, get away with it a little bit more than some other teams in the league.

I was born and raised a Flyers fan and learned fairly early on in life that being a Flyers fan came with a negative stereotype and some ugly presumptions. If I stepped a toe out of line or messed up even a little bit, I would be classified as just another one of those horrible Flyers fans. I realized that I was representative of a Flyers fan and meeting someone from out of the area, I might be the first Flyers fan they met, cementing their opinion of Flyers fans today. I&#039;ve had fans tell me &quot;gee, you&#039;re nothing like I expected.&quot; Ummm thanks!?!?!?!

This isn&#039;t just one fan with a Twitter account, this is a team account. Representing the entire Kings organization. An organization which is trying to grow its fan base. I think they have to be careful with that line because once they cross it, it&#039;s very hard to go back. I think you also have to be doubly careful on the internet because unless it comes with an audio clip, tone and sarcasm can be difficult to pick up on and easily misinterpreted. 

Many fans have a moment that stands out in their minds, if you ask them about why they don&#039;t like a team, organization, etc. I still very vividly remember the article that appeared in the Washington Post in 2007 or 2008 saying that female Flyers fans were so ugly they should work security for Megadeth. (Which I don&#039;t hold against the Caps, but it absolutely catalyzed that series). The Kings want to be careful they don&#039;t end up setting off another team&#039;s fan base.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I saw these comments last night and like you I wondered the same thing. As a celebrity, athlete or regular person, you should be able to say whatever you want. However, you need to be prepared for the consequences of your words and/or actions. That being said sometimes it&#039;s better to remember your good ol&#039; mom&#039;s advice &quot;if you have nothing good to say, don&#039;t say anything.&quot; 

Speaking on behalf of an organization, company or person you take the high road. That&#039;s not to say you can&#039;t have fun with social media, as the Kings did last year. 

I follow the Kings, they are my second favorite team. I found their chirping to be off-putting. I even wondered if it was The Royal Half (a Kings blog) who may have made those comments. TRH took over the Kings Twitter account - I believe it was - during the second period of the Ducks game on Monday night.]]></description>
