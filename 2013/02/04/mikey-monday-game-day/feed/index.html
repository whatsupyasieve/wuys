As a result, Parsons decided to retire. In 1997, Bob Parsons came out of his retirement to launch a new company, Jomax Technologies which later became GoDaddy Group Inc.;`

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s probably a good thing for humanity that I already have Mr. Pants because Mike Green and I have the same hair, except mine is curly.  When I was little, I looked like mid-90&#039;s Jagr.  If Mike and I had kids, they would never be able to get helmets on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s also twice as thick. Have you verified that firsthand? He probably needs super thick hair ties to keep it out of his face. 

Also, Crosby...your cheekbones.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Pens just announced that Martin&#039;s goal was actually tipped in by Kunitz meaning....he&#039;s the first Penguin to score four goals in a game since Jagr on October 14, 2000 (thanks Facebook!)

What a beauty that game was - zero stress, a perfect Sunday afternoon and seeing the Pens beat down on the Caps? Gorgeous. Except for seeing Mike&#039;s flow out the back of his helmet when went for a goal celebration by the bench - I&#039;d forgotten just how long his hair is. Remember the good ol&#039; days? When Mike had perfect Hedgehog hair? When Sid&#039;s brain wasn&#039;t broken? Yeah, me too. Anyways, perfect game nonetheless. Go Pens!]]></description>
