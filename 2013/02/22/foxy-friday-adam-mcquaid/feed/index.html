		<description><![CDATA[Your site is hilarious, I&#039;ve stumbled upon it a few times in the past. I absolutely LOVE this post. Quaider is my absolute favorite Bruin, it&#039;s nice to see him in the spotlight for a change...he&#039;s generally outshined by the Seguins and Bergerons of the Bruin squad. You might consider Krejci for a foxy Friday...he is not only extremely talented yet modest, but he&#039;s sexy as hell and has an AWESOME accent! Just wait til he gets his front tooth fixed from the high stick he got in Toronto the other night...hahahaha]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m having inner turmoil over this Foxy. I have, outspokenly, been opposed to this man ever since he ran at El Cap-i-tan Richards May 3, 2011 and ended up boarding himself. http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/console?id=112617 I have tried on many occasions to forgive him of his transgressions and he just does something else to piss me off. Ultimately though, I think it&#039;s the hair. I can&#039;t get past the hair. Lord knows with a hat on he could defile my existence but I just don&#039;t understand how someone could intentionally walk around looking like Jagr&#039;s love child. This is a battle of internal epic proportions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I absolutely LOVE the photo of him in the maroon tshirt on the train. I remember when Ference posted it to Twitter when the guys were headed to NYC during the lockout. It was this photo that made me realize what I was missing. I&#039;m now sitting shotgun on the Quaider-train!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I might be flailing at my desk right now. 

I may enjoy Ebby&#039;s face and everything about Tazer&#039;s life but there is only jersey I wear and that&#039;s this man&#039;s. Whether it&#039;s on the ice or off, Quaider is my favorite Bruin. I could write a novel! I am so happy to see I&#039;m not the only one who thinks he&#039;s foxy!

But I will fight you for him. Seriously.]]></description>
