		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Every day is Christmas for this dude.&quot;

I&#039;m so happy that someone else noticed this.  All I can think when I see video of him is he&#039;s seriously just so! happy! to be here!  And his smile should seriously be illegal.

		<description><![CDATA[My favorite part of the head-shaving video is when they introduce Justin Schultz. People cheer. The look on his face ... priceless. Every day is Christmas for this dude. The Oilers are deep in hilarity - Gagner, Smid, Jonesy, DUBY! to name a few. Without out a doubt, Oilers and Blackhawks are best at marketing the team/players. Pens right up there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[These videos are perfection. I don&#039;t know whose social media people I like more - Edmonton&#039;s or Chicago&#039;s. Either way, they know exactly what we&#039;re all looking for. 

Why don&#039;t the Bruins do fun things like this for me to swoon over between games?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why are we even discussing #TeamHall vs. #TeamEbs when there is #TeamCorey. Sorry Chuck, but I may have to fight you. No. Fighting is too aggressive. Rock, scissors, paper, lizard, Spock. But I go to Edmonton. A lot. I&#039;m going again in May. Just saying.]]></description>
