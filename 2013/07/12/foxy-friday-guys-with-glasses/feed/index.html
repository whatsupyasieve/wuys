And here&#039;s a thought: Do Paulie and Nealmobile trade glasses just for giggles to see who bumps into the wall first? :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This post has me in stitches! 

The photo zooming in on Neal&#039;s glasses on his nightstand ... oh my God! Giggling like a little girl at my desk.

And I&#039;m with Carter, I think I prefer Geno in glasses. Definitely a good look for him.

Of course, I&#039;m always partial to this photo ... http://25.media.tumblr.com/6add07350fde3d9d436fccd8836b4cbb/tumblr_mk8gjzaCpt1qm6joao1_500.jpg]]></description>
