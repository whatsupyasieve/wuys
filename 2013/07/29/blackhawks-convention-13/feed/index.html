		<description><![CDATA[I was sitting in this panel and when the girl asked them to do the dance off Tazer was like &quot;no way&quot; until we all started booing at him! Not taking that very well, he slammed his hand on the table and got up to do something that he calls the moonwalk. Not sure what the rest of the world would call it! This is my 3rd season and I am already planning my trip back for year 4! The BEST comment of the day however was a younger boy getting up and telling Crawford that he played his nuts off! Tazer was more embarrassed than Corey! I will have pictures to you in a few days.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a life-long Chicagoan I thought I&#039;d take a moment to answer your semi-rhetorical question.  The reason there is a Hawks Convention is because one of the first things the new owner did in 2007 was hire the president and long-time marketing director of the Chicago Cubs to be president of the team.  The man is a genius, consistently drawing 2+ million people a year to Wrigley Field despite some very, very bad teams. The Cubs Convention has been running for decades.  So, John McDonough is the man to thank for all of this awesomeness; not just the convention, but Blackhawks TV (website videos) too. (I think you&#039;ve blogged about Joey the Junior Reporter before.) The good news is I think most major league baseball teams have annual fan conventions now, so maybe the hockey teams will catch on too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[WHY DON&#039;T THE RANGERS HAVE THIS?!?!

Seriously, this is beyond amazing and I kind of hate (but only out of jealousy, I swear) Hawks fans for having this much awesomeness.

But could you imagine this with Lundqvist, Girardi, Hagelin, Boyle, Pyatt, et al?  I&#039;d probably stroke out, but I can&#039;t think of a better way to go out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What the hell is with this post and all the ridiculousness??? The Blackhawks Convention is some mythical entity where you can make them show off their tats, dance, undo their shirts and pat their bums just by asking - ALL OTHER TEAMS, TAKE NOTE. YOU&#039;RE DOING IT WRONG. The August long weekend in Canada is days away and I know what I&#039;m spending three DAYS holed up in my house - catching up on HOURS of gloriousness. Bless you, Blackhawks.]]></description>

I&#039;m still bitter. However, I plugged my ear buds into my phone while at my desk.. I&#039;m sure if I watched this on my work computer my supervisor would probably be like, &#039;now how do the Blackhawks help us fundraise for our nonprofit in Vermont?&#039; To which I would have replied &#039;sometimes our work can be depressing, so I needed a pick me up,&#039; and while I&#039;m not sad this little gem was priceless. I started laughing, my floor was like &#039;what&#039;s so funny on the database?&#039; And the rest is just as awkward as the dance off. I&#039;m slightly less bitter towards the Hawks after this video.]]></description>
