		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, I have no idea what I just pressed but it posted while I was still typing.

Anyway, I was saying, that regarding typical 21 year old behavior, I call bullsh*t.  You have a job, get paid a lot of money, know what the expectations are, are coddled, and you still can&#039;t get it together?  Man, I was married, going to school, and working as a 21 year old and never missed a day, meeting, or deadline while still acing my classes.  Grow up!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am finally getting caught up on my reading from the holiday weekend so I am commenting late.

I have to say that I am remarkably (maybe surprisingly) okay with this trade.  I would have liked to see them hold onto him for another year, but I like the return they got for him, and if he played poorly next year, they wouldn&#039;t have gotten such a good return.  

As far as the behind the scenes stuff, we will never really know what happened, but I have a feeling they gave him a lot of chances to get his act together and he didn&#039;t.  Going to Dallas may be a serious wakeup call for him.  You like playing in the SCF two out of three years?  Think the playoffs just happen?  Think you can score one goal and it won&#039;t matter because the team will be there next year?  Sorry kid, it&#039;s not that easy and it ain&#039;t gonna happen in Dallas - at least not soon.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m still coming to grips with this. I honestly don&#039;t think it&#039;s gonna hit me til the season starts back up. 

Who&#039;s to know what was really going on on-ice and off-ice or how bad it really was. Like Mama Seguin, as Jess put it, I keep coming to his defense. He&#039;s 21, making (at this point) $900,000 with no parents around for the last three years, what do you expect? 

As my favorite player, I don&#039;t like what I&#039;ve been reading: about his partying ways interfering with his game, that teammates never really took to him, he&#039;s arrogant, irresponsible. But maybe Boston was too much for him between the bright media spotlight and the pressure of being in a HUGE sports town. Some players can&#039;t deal with it and maybe, sadly, Segs is one of them.

So I&#039;m hoping Dallas will be a fresh start for him. I&#039;m sure he&#039;s no doubt pissed to be traded--he&#039;s got quite the entourage there--but maybe a city with a dimmer spotlight and slower pace will be good for him and his game. Not to mention he&#039;ll be back to playing center with Dallas. 

Boston or Dallas, I&#039;ll be watching Segs wherever he&#039;s playing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know why I am having such a hard time with this trade. I mean, if anything he&#039;s going to a team where he can excel and really be star (see what I did there?) and stand out instead of being on a team full of outstanding players where he really can&#039;t find the right fit. AND he&#039;s moving to a team closer to my time-zone! Like you said, maybe the claims of off-ice issues are legit, but I am still with Mama Seguin and definitely believe a lot of those stories are some CYA from the Bruins execs to try and quell a fan backlash.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t forget that time when Seguin overslept and missed a team meeting/breakfast and ended up being a healthy scratch. As much as this might make sense with the numbers, I can&#039;t help but feel Seguin has been pushing the wrong buttons for some time now and they finally got fed up!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My first reaction to the trade was not Loui, but I do love having Seguin on the team.  Never thought I&#039;d ever see Seguin on the Stars or Loui in another jersey.

Should Seguin win a cup with the Stars, I hope for pictures of him riding a mechanical bull while drunk.  One day Stars fans can thank Toronto.

Maybe now Loui will stop being Mr. Underrated and the NHL will pay more attention to him.

Hopefully this is a trade that both teams win.]]></description>
