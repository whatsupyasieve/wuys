		<description><![CDATA[OMG!  Their pants just look so weird.  I&#039;m thinking maybe it&#039;s because the shirt was tucked in, but then I realized, it was their hockey butts.  They just kinda make the pants look....I don&#039;t know.  Found this post highly amusing!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I second all of that. And he IS much more magnificent in person. I&#039;m not sure how he manages that, but it&#039;s true. And it&#039;s magical. It even makes us overlook the scary fashion mistakes (his shoes are almost always horrible)! I&#039;m with you on the hair, too, Jana. I&#039;m not usually into that, either, but so help me, I just want to touch his hair!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Having met James Neal in person last summer, I can verify he&#039;s even better looking in person. BUT, I can&#039;t forgive him either for his fashion choices--at least on the golf course. His shoes look like he should be a grandpa in Florida and the white belt ends up just cutting his body in half. It&#039;s not good.

But then I see that hair. I&#039;m not normally a long-hair-on-a-guy-kinda girl, but on James, it works. 

Dammit. I forgive you Neal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I approve of both men&#039;s golf attire, hideous belts and all, except what are those shoes James is wearing?  They look like orthopedic geriatric shoes like Grandma used to wear.  I&#039;ll just focus from the waist up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[LORD. If there was ever a summer I wish I lived in Toronto....THIS ONE. They can never be apart. Do you think Steven asked Nate Thompson if he could bring Neal as his date to the wedding? They&#039;re going to Newfoundland next week together (of course) and I can&#039;t wait for the shenanigans.

As for the JT/Jay Z concert, according to Alison the heat inside Rogers Centre was so intense it could have killed someone. No wonder James&#039; hair looks amazing. All that humidity...the curls. I can&#039;t even. Summer is the best. I almost don&#039;t even want it to be October. Did I really just say that?]]></description>
