		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m convinced we&#039;re not going to make it through the summer without news of a Blackhawks arrest. And unlike the last time, not convinced it won&#039;t be Kaner. My money&#039;s on Toews. Tumblr is a scary, scary place right now. Jonny, it&#039;s like I don&#039;t even know you any more! And...I LOVE IT. Just be safe this summer!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What a fun day! The parade was spectacular--even if the buses did hightail it past us! But I can&#039;t complain, I had front row &quot;seats&quot; along Washington Street and it couldn&#039;t have been a more beautiful day! Marian Hossa waved right at me; Nick Leddy paid special attention to my friend&#039;s son by pointing at him; the dog that was surrounded by at least 30 Chicagoans, sitting patiently and perfectly for pics; and the Swedes ... oh, the Swedes. All four on one bus. I could&#039;ve died happy.

Now we can all look forward to video and pictures to come of players&#039; day with the Cup. Didn&#039;t Toews get a lake or town or something named after him last time? What&#039;s next? A territory? I&#039;d move there. Just sayin&#039;.]]></description>
