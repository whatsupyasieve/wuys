		<description><![CDATA[I also like John Carlson&#039;s account. But I want to take a moment to mourn over the fact so many of them have private IG accounts. I would love to see what Landeskog and Giroux have in their accounts, along with Erik Johnson. Erik Johnson is very entertaining with the sarcastic humor and I love his interactions with teammates on twitter. His IG has to be gold.

Honorable mention goes to all of Landeskog&#039;s Swedish friends who post so many good pics of him.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gotta go with Geno. I don&#039;t think even Russians can understand his captions. Plus, the glasses and the pictures with the random plastic penguins have increased my level of interest in his account exponentially. 

Although I must say, Sexy Seguin is a cllllooooose second. Despite the fact that, yes, more pictures of Marshall are needed. And I wouldn&#039;t even be mad if a video of him partying with Freddy Bender found it&#039;s way into my feed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love that Bobby Ryan loves his cats so unabashedly when pretty much every other hockey player is a dog person (except of course for Zenon Konopka and his pawesome bunny).

As for my faves, I don&#039;t know that I can pick one, but I&#039;m partial to brichards_1991, brandonprust8, bbickell &#038; guddy44 (the last 2 feature lots of pups, so that&#039;s always going to get my attention).]]></description>
