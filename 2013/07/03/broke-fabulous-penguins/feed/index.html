		<description><![CDATA[I completely agree with the points on Letang - but it looks like Shero is convinced with enough O you don&#039;t need D (and look where that got us with the B&#039;s?!).  

I AM however, happy that I get to still oogle Letang in a Pens uniform...it would have been a little tough in someone else&#039;s sweater (but I think I would have managed).

Also on that note...why does he always tuck that sweater in like an old man?!  I mean, he&#039;s completely identifiable on the ice, but I&#039;d rather be smitten by your dashing good looks - not questioning your fashion decision.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kunitz is foxy. I said it, I don&#039;t even care. I&#039;m under the Pens spell and I LOVE IT. Yeah they&#039;ve committed all that money to these players BUT LOOK AT THOSE PLAYERS. 

I can&#039;t tell who&#039;s more happy about Dupuis: Crosby or James Neal. Or James Neal&#039;s hair.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Letang is getting WAY too much money for a guy who&#039;s not all that solid defensively.  I think if he weren&#039;t playing on a team with Malkin &#038; Crosby, his offensive numbers would be much, much lower (and then becomes just an average player offensively AND defensively).  To me, he&#039;s overrated.  Sorry, Pants.

But Monchichis!  Wow, that takes me back... I will never be able to look at Chris Kunitz the same way again.  Spot on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a Pens hater (sorry!), but I do think that the Letang contract when he does what he&#039;s supposed to do, is totally worth it. He&#039;s a player that plays two way hockey and if he continues to do so I think it&#039;s well worth the money for the Pens.  I&#039;m curious to see what the Penguins do with Fleury though after next season.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As I was doing all the Penguins cap space math last night, all I could think about was &quot;thank god Shero traded TK to San Jose&quot;. Shero and Jason Botterill are cap magicians, but I don&#039;t think even they could have found $2 mil to give TK next season. (Also, GOODBYE OL&#039; BOY. I will miss you. Go &quot;be a shooter&quot; in SJ.)

$4.1 million left to share (likely) between Adams, Cooke, Bortuzzo, and Jeffrey.. it seemed impossible at times, but I think it&#039;s actually all going to work out.]]></description>
