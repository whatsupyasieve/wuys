		<description><![CDATA[Carter, I love you.  &quot;Awkward virgin wingman&quot; - HA!  I didn&#039;t know he was engaged.  Yay, Piglet!  Apparently he confirmed in a radio interview (in Swedish, very helpful) that they are expecting in October.  I hope the baby is born on Mike&#039;s birthday, it would be fitting.

I also appreciate you assuming that Danny Briere took my feelings into account... then went to Montreal anyway.  Without so much as a sympathy cake delivery.  MEN. GAH.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have this dream where Sam Ganger goes to the Islanders so he and Tavares can be the best bromance in hockey.  Or dorkiest.  God, I love them.  The Oilers probably won&#039;t let him get away (he&#039;s RFA) and I don&#039;t see him taking a 1-year deal to be UFA next year.  But in my head this all works out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The fact that there was even hope for Briere going to the Islanders and then he wound up with the Habs actually broke my heart. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever been this bummed out about us not getting a player. Also, yeah 23 under the cap and they&#039;re not trying to sign anyone. The Islanders make such bad choices sometimes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know that 35 is old is hockey years (is there a conversion chart of actual age to hockey age?) But, Danny B. and I are the same age, he&#039;s only older by 2 months. 35 is not old! :)

Oh, how I&#039;m going to miss watching him play for Philly. 
The Habs!? We&#039;re going to have to start calling him Daniel aren&#039;t we?
