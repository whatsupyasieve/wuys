		<description><![CDATA[On the days of high-stress game situations (Game 7 tonight, Saturday&#039;s Game 6 Pens/Isles match-up) I find myself in public watching others and thinking:

&quot;Look at all these people - buying groceries, having a drink on the patio - living their lives normally. They&#039;re not consumed by hockey, waking up at 7 am on a Saturday thinking about puck drop, sick to their stomachs all day about a GAME.&quot;

My husband teases me that it&#039;s all just pretend - FALSE, SIR. I wouldn&#039;t trade any of it for the world especially when I think of the h*ll we went through with the lockout (shudders) but sometimes I strain to remember what life was like BHO - Before Hockey Obsession. Dark days indeed, but a simpler time.

To all the Bs/Leafs/Caps/Rangers fans...enjoy tonight. There&#039;s nothing like Game 7s.]]></description>
