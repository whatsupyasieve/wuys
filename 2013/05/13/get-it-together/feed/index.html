		<description><![CDATA[No harm, no foul! I think you know how I feel about the stupid &quot;Thank you, Kessel&quot; chant, so I was just playing on that. Honestly, us Leafs fans are just so happy to even be in the playoffs again, this series is pretty much a fairy tale and I&#039;m loving every minute of it. (Even if it is super stressful and makes me want to cry at times.)

And Brenda - I think I finally understand where Drake was trying to go with his tree shaking metaphor tweet last night now, haha!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[omg, I didn&#039;t mean that in a mean way! I just meant that that is literally all that was going through my head when I heard it. Because let&#039;s be honest, he went from pretty much single handedly dominating the Leafs to well, looking really scared of them. And hell, if I were a Leafs fan, I&#039;d be saying it too!]]></description>
