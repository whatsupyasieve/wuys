		<description><![CDATA[There is no known cure for multiple sclerosis. Treatments attempt to return function after an attack, prevent new attacks, and prevent disability. MS medications can have adverse effects or be poorly tolerated, and many people pursue alternative treatments, despite the lack of evidence. The long term outcome is difficult to predict; depending on the subtype of the disease, the individual&#039;s disease characteristics, the initial symptoms and the degree of disability the person experiences over time.&quot;^..

		<description><![CDATA[It is possible to overdose.  Remember, lots of fluids.  Maybe a cold shower.  Some soothing yoga mantras.  You&#039;ll be okay. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Haha the Pens game was handily won and I&#039;m still having a nervous breakdown because of how many stupid penalties they gave up and what that will mean when they are playing teams who will be able to take advantage of that...

Also, I&#039;m going to the Caps/Rangers game tonight with a co-worker/friend, so this should be... interesting. Whether he is still willing to associate with me afterwards may be another story...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was screaming at the television trying to get my CBC feeds sorted and had to resort to streaming it on my hubby&#039;s iMac, HUMUNGOUS BIG rum and coke in hand to solve everything. Everyone who said &quot;Hawks in four!&quot; - pfffffft. It ain&#039;t gonna come that easy. Please see Audrey Hepburn above. We&#039;ve got two more months of this, times a bajillion if you&#039;re a Pens fan as well like I know many of us are. I totally am having a nervous breakdown. But there really isn&#039;t anything like playoffs, is there? Best time of the year.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure how I&#039;m going to survive through these following weeks. I live in Finland so I have to follow the NHL playoffs at night and next friday the WC-A  tournament starts (and many of the teams are full of NHL players). Is it possible to get overdose of good hockey (and hot hockey players)?]]></description>
