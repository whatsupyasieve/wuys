		<description><![CDATA[YES! I am all for this FF! :) I&#039;ve always liked how under the radar Krejci is. Seems like a solid guy, on and off the ice.

Chuck, can come over tonight and watch the game with you? I don&#039;t have the NHL Network and you&#039;ll at least have the NESN feed. I think if I get on a plane RIGHT NOW, I&#039;ll just miss the beginning of the 1st period.

And thank you, I&#039;m never going to hear &quot;Call Me Maybe&quot; the same ever again! Fantastic!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is something oddly attractive about him despite more than a passing resemblance to Jon Heder.  Maybe it is because he is European or because he is so low-key.  I just don&#039;t know.  

What I do know that right now, there is no one foxier. He&#039;s TEARIN&#039; UP THE HEARTS of the Leafs and their fans with his super human play in the playoffs.  It&#039;s like he can just flip a switch when they start and become this hockey machine. 

LOVE IT!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No other words needed just, Yes. Krej does not receive as much love as he should. He really is the epitome of what it means to be a Bruin.  I literally said, YES when I saw he was chosen as FF this week. He is great. Much love to number 46!]]></description>
