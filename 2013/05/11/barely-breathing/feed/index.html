		<description><![CDATA[Thank god we survived, thank god, thank god. And by god, I mean Crosby.

Oh! And we discovered the secret behind the MGB (mysteriously ginger beard) - someone on the Yahoo Board says it&#039;s because Neal is possibly Irish? Apparently no matter how brown your hair is, if you&#039;re an Irish boy your beard will be all ginger...making me melt to the floor in a puddle. Not so mysterious anymore.

Keep doin&#039; what you&#039;re doing Neal. That beard is OUTSTANDING.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s the thing, if I didn&#039;t already love the Penguins so much I would have wanted the Islanders to win.  they deserved to win.  As you said, they played their hearts out,  and they were skilled.

But maybe it all comes down to the beard.  I do love Neal&#039;s crazy mismatched ginger beard.  I love Depuis&#039; thickening thatch!  I love Sid&#039;s baby scruff...but the question is:  Why the heck is Malkin baby faced?  This is the playoffs man...man up!  I noticed this happened last year.  Guess what, last year Geno choked.  This year, still not impressed.  Grow a beard, be a man, play on!!!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Phheeww!...you&#039;re absolutely right, it wasn&#039;t pretty. and I will admit that the Islanders were like the rebellion against the evil Empire and I was so frustrated and irritated with my beloved Penguins! I think they have gotten their shit together (at least they better have) cause the Sens will be like the Grudge girl regarding Karlsson vs. Cookie. I won&#039;t join the Fleury scapegoat bandwagon, but Vokoun is/was my hero. At least for Game 5!

That picture is Sid&#039;s peach fuzz is still HOTT!! lol]]></description>
