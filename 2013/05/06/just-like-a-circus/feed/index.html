		<description><![CDATA[During yesterday&#039;s game my husband actually said &quot;I&#039;m so happy the Islanders are in the playoffs.&quot; I told him, &quot;You can either sit here and not talk or I&#039;m going to watch this game somewhere else - your choice.&quot; And then the Islanders scored.

Too many turnovers, too many problems with puck possession...GUYS. Defense is a thing. Let&#039;s play it. I&#039;m wearing all of my Pens gear for tomorrow&#039;s game and starting the drinking EARLY &#039;cuz I fear the Islanders are gonna bring it. Like some middle school fight at the bike racks, 4:15. It&#039;s gonna get scrappy. 

I just hope the team remembers that Crosby didn&#039;t come back from his jaw break as soon as possible just to play golf next week.]]></description>
