		<description><![CDATA[Just stumbled on this site.  Great job!  I look forward to reading it every week.  I also agree with you re: defending Cup champions.  Like you, unless it&#039;s my team, would prefer not to be the repeat champion.  People think I weird but now that you said it too I feel I&#039;m no so crazy.  Can&#039;t wait until tomorrow.  It&#039;s going to be good!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m apparently a sadist because I just watched that video again. The look Toews gives Seabrook as he&#039;s coming up to the penalty box (at 2:27) is heartbreaking. 

Come on Hawks! Let&#039;s exorcise some demons tonight!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[JEEEEEEEEESUS. I was watching these games while on a teeny island off BC so had streaming issues with CBC (shakes fist and growls) and hence missed this intro.

God, rip out my heart, why don&#039;t you CBC? Did someone steal Toews&#039; iPod and find the song most played on repeat? Ouch. Tazer for all the hugs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have 2 things to say.  The first is that I still cannot watch the HNIC opening from Hawks/Wings game 5 all the way through because that song + JToews = feeeeeeeeeeeelings.
[reference - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jnt-urnBcis]

Secondly I literally have no words for that Seabs + JToews interaction.  Because it is way too much for me to handle.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While I may not have followed as closely as I should have over the last two decades, I&#039;ve been a Blackhawks fan since the early 90s. Therefore, I hate the Red Wings. It&#039;s just instilled in me. I&#039;ve been praying to the hockey gods that we beat the Red Wings. I didn&#039;t care how we did it. Four games? Sweet! Seven games? Fine. Just beat &#039;em!!

I barely sat down during last night&#039;s remaining 10 minutes of game 6. So stressful. But what a game! I can only imagine what game 7 is going to be like on Wednesday.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been waxing poetic for days about how this Blackhawks/Red Wings series is the Pens/Flyers series of this playoffs - how the Hawks have had a chance to do something amazing, but have been playing too emotional, b*tching at the refs, not playing smart (Toews, I joke about trips to the sin bin with you but even this is too much). I&#039;ve been telling myself for days that they&#039;re blowing their amazing season and that if they lose, I&#039;ll be OK.

Wrong. False. I can&#039;t quit you. The stress of these last two games is indicative enough. You have the fight in you, Hawks. Don&#039;t let these Red Wings end what has been a memorable season, no matter how much we love Mike Babcock.]]></description>
