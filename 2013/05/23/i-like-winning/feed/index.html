		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m on holidays on a teeny Canadian island so had to stream this on CBC and the feed cut out JUST as Scott Oake was interviewing James Neal after the game. My screen froze on James&#039; Ridiculously Ginger Beard (forget the Mysteriously Ginger Beard, we&#039;re alllllll about the RGB now) and my hubby was like &quot;well at least you can fawn over his ginger beard now.&quot; At least he gave me permission, right?

50% of the reason I want the Pens to advance to the next round is to see the RGB continue to epic levels. Zero shame in admitting that.]]></description>
