		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad to see all of these Red Wings fans in the comments. Sometimes I feel all alone on this site!! :-(

TooToo and Smith were my favorite players this year (I mean, besides Pavel, duh), so I was really glad to see them in back to back FFs. But now I agree with Sinochick- I think you jinxed my team!]]></description>

Unfortunately for me, these youngsters make me feel like Mrs. Robinson--I&#039;m old enough to be their mother. But hell, however old I am, I can still look, can&#039;t I?]]></description>
