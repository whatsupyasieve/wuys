		<description><![CDATA[Kudos on the Brian Bickell love. My friend Diana will be very happy. While I find it hard to look past his missing teeth, he seems like a good guy and is currently, in my opinion and in the opinion of people who count in such matters, is the best value for money in the NHL right now AND has the best playoff shooting % of any player still in the playoffs!

Let&#039;s hope the Hawks make him a good offer in the off-season and lock him up for a little while longer.]]></description>
