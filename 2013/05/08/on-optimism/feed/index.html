		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Pants. I really needed this. Especially after reading practice today was canceled. Which I&#039;m hoping is translating into a much needed &#039;come to jesus&#039; meeting and lots of video review on the stuff got wrong *and* the stuff got right so far in the series.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I should learn to not watch the post-game videos or read the beat reporters&#039; Twitter posts, and instead come here for sane, rational logic. This was just what the doctor ordered. Very good, Pants - very smart. You talked me away from the ledge that I&#039;ve been creeping towards.

Today&#039;s optional (really Disco? Optional?) practice will be very interesting to see who shows up. And if anyone but Vokoun is in net tomorrow (seriously, can we get Kipper? Schneider? LOLuongo?)...I know there&#039;s a good chance I&#039;ll be sliding back into my hopeless pit of despair.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Pants!  It is good to know that your voice of reason can talk the rest of us down off the ledge.  Here&#039;s hoping that the Pens get their act together, finish off the Islanders, tear through the rest of the playoffs and bring the Cup back to Pittsburgh.  That or I&#039;m going to start trolling the Sidney Crosby fan fiction sites...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This deserves endless RTs on the Twittah Machine, Miss P!! Soon as my bunker of an office gives me a modicum of cell service, I&#039;m doing just that. LOVE your math - because it&#039;s CORRECT. Boys seem to play better D in front of Voky (God only knows WHY, but who cares?!?), so maybe that will help. Also, read in Dejan&#039;s &#038; Rossi&#039;s columns in the Tribune Review that there was definitely ANGER in the room last night. Probably NOT a bad thing at this point. I&#039;m joining you in numerous rounds of that Stage 5 dependency! haha Barkeep.....]]></description>
