		<description><![CDATA[I just have this feeling that I&#039;m not going to be overly mad about any penalties the Pens take against Karlsson or Neil this series. Which is bad. And I&#039;m not actively encouraging it in all situations. But my disdain is just SO STRONG.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think Neal was trying to add some &quot;bad boy&quot; elements into his competition with Sid, in case the beard isn&#039;t enough. It&#039;s all about winning... which, if I were the judge, he would. But I do applaud Sid&#039;s effort. It&#039;s first-class.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not wrong at all. I&#039;m not really mad, either - mostly because the replay was outstanding and Karlsson had better LEARN. And it was more time to admire the beard.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is it wrong that I&#039;m not even mad about the third penalty Neal took last night? The second one was such a sell job by Karlsson and the Pens were already in control of the game at that point. I&#039;d like to think in a tighter game he doesn&#039;t take that third penalty.. but I&#039;m okay with sending Karlsson a &quot;this is what happens when you embellish&quot; message given the circumstances.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, I had so much time to admire that #gingerbeard...what with your SIX MINUTES of penalty time, Neal. Try not to do that next game, and maybe play some hockey, eh? (not even trying to disguise my Canadian, Pants)

In the Pens hair competition, Letang always wins but clearly Crosby&#039;s trying to beat out James for second - Nealer&#039;s trying to lay it all out on the line with the beard. I&#039;ll enjoy seeing this talent competition. And more importantly, the Pens play real hockey versus whatever that was versus the Islanders (aka chasing children around the ice).

Tonight - the Hawks. Fingers crossed their sense of control and calm hockey continues from where we left off from Minnesota.]]></description>
