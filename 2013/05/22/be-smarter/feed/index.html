		<description><![CDATA[I think that in general people are too sensitive and need to just let things slough off sometimes, however, this is one area where I never think it is funny or appropriate.

I was horrified by all the comments over at Puck Daddy on this subject.  &quot;Get a life!&quot;  &quot;Toughen up!&quot;  &quot;Don&#039;t be so easily offended!&quot;  It is easy for a man to say that when his chance of being sexually assaulted is small.  Since most sexual assault is perpetrated by men against women, I found the lack of empathy and understanding for those that may have been offended to be more disturbing than the actual tweet.  I am not sure that much headway will be made surrounding &#039;rape culture&#039; in our society until the dialog amongst the male population changes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for finding the words I was looking for re: the apologies. Should the shock jock get a free pass? Absolutely not. But should the general public be treated as smart enough to know when they should and shouldn&#039;t find something offensive withouth having to be told &quot;THIS IS OFFENSIVE!&quot;? Probably (although, the general smartness, or lack there of, of the general population always surprises and upsets me. I should be used to it by now).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sadly, I have become as desensitized by the apologies as I have the off-color jokes.

I think it was tasteless and crude, but at the same time, I shrug my shoulders. This is the world we live in, where any publicity--even bad--is good publicity.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This makes me sad and angry.

This makes me sad because I love the Kings Twitter feed, and I would hate for this incident to completely ruin all the generally good, chirpy fun.

This makes me angry because not only do I not find rape jokes funny, but because I f-ing HATE IT when people &quot;apologize&quot; by saying &quot;IF you were offended by what I said, then I&#039;m sorry for THAT.&quot;  That is NOT an apology.  That is a passive aggressive way of saying &quot;I&#039;m being forced to apologize, but I really don&#039;t mean it.&quot;  If that&#039;s what you&#039;re going to say, then just don&#039;t apologize, because it&#039;s incredibly insulting to everyone&#039;s intelligence and possibly  the only thing that makes me angrier than a rape joke.

I respect Vanessa&#039;s thoughtful and well-stated opinion about needing to joke about everything.  And I am, in general, very difficult to offend with humor.  My sense of humor is very dark, and I&#039;m usually the one having to think &quot;Is this going to get me sent to HR?&quot; before -- or sadly, sometimes after -- saying something.  But at the risk of sounding way over-dramatic, I find the prevalence of rape culture, especially in sports and media, to be an absolute scourge on humanity, and I just can&#039;t excuse it.  Especially when it&#039;s done in such a public, &quot;official&quot; forum.  

And what might even be the absolute worst of this is that the &quot;joke&quot; was NOT EVEN FUNNY.  Not even a little a bit.  Not even in a way that I don&#039;t want to admit publicly, but privately snickered at for a second.  If you&#039;re going to wave your &quot;I&#039;m the edgy shock jock guy who pushes people&#039;s buttons&quot; flag, for crying out loud, at least be GOOD at it.  This is not just offensive - it&#039;s offensive and lame and just pathetic.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This goes into a whole can of worms I feel about things like that. Sexual assault isn&#039;t funny, no, but I also think the joke itself was so obviously not about someone truly being sexually assaulted. And the thing is, I take sexual assault very seriously, not just because I, like way too many women I know, have been victim of it, but because it&#039;s an ongoing problem in rape culture. But at the same token, by affording this level of gravitas to it as a topic, by making it something that can&#039;t ever be taken as less than 100% serious, I feel we&#039;ve only given rape culture more power. And quite frankly, while I think the joke was stupid, it&#039;s stupid not because it&#039;s rape culture, but because it&#039;s another banal &quot;shock&quot; jock or whatever being stupid. They&#039;re trying too hard. 

But speaking for myself, I need for there to be the ability to joke about things, including sexual assault. I need there to be times when it&#039;s not taken so seriously, because otherwise, I buckle under the weight of it, I take myself as victim too seriously. And that&#039;s not undermining the tragedy of it, but the fact is, that my life does not deserve to be rendered down to only this thing. I am more than a victim and I can laugh about it. 

But that&#039;s me, and I don&#039;t claim to speak for anyone else. Given that I can and do find humor in absolutely everything, I&#039;m maybe the queen of bad jokes, so take that as you will. And, of course, there&#039;s a difference between humor as coping method and humor for cheap laughs.   

Honestly, I do think the Kings need to stop handing their twitter account over for guest tweeting; they do well when it&#039;s them, so why the need for guests?]]></description>
