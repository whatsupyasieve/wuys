		<description><![CDATA[There is so much joy in that gif it maybe brings a little tear to my eye.

Also - there is so much justice in Seabs scoring the game/series winning goal, I cannot even begin to explain how happy it makes me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like to imagine that Brent Seabrook is like Penn Badgely&#039;s character in Easy A: a hot guy who doesn&#039;t really know it who will rock a woodchuck costume, all the while giving ZERO f*cks. I ADORE him. ADORE.

AND he&#039;s a hometown boy (well a suburb of my hometown... which isn&#039;t really my hometown, but it&#039;s where I live now and it&#039;s close to my hometown... homeprovince boy. That&#039;s more accurate). I have so many one-degrees of separation. Most recently I sat next to this nice old man on the plane who said that he&#039;s neighbours with Seabs in the summer, but that his place was for sale because he was going to just keep his place in Kelowna. And I&#039;m sure it&#039;s no coincidence that that&#039;s where Duncan Keith lives in the summer. Summer road trip to the Okanagan anyone?

I totally had a plot to this comment, but I have completely lost it. To sum up, I love Brent Seabrook and I am totally buying a #7 jersey next time I go to Chicago.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If work hadn&#039;t been so crazy at the time, I planned on making a Seabs post myself when you were taking submissions - but I am actually so glad I didn&#039;t. The Game 7 celebration gifs/photos are probably my favorite things ever and his Foxy Friday would have been incomplete without them.

Also, this sentence is perfection and I laughed for a long time: &quot;But don’t forget Toews, who sometimes looks at Seabrook so longingly you know he’s wondering how he ended up with Kane.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two things:

1) THAT GIF of Seabs breaking through the celebration hug??? I. CAN&#039;T. EVEN. It is the greatest. He&#039;s either screaming or gasping for air or both but it is the best.

2) SWOON TO THAT WEDDING PARTY. 

Excellent choice ladies. Highly approve.]]></description>
