Oh, and my vote for #BreadWatch2013 is either light rye or cheese bagels. :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have loved Corey Crawford for a long time! Love hearing he&#039;ll be getting some love soon! I&#039;ve considered suggesting him for a FF post, but there aren&#039;t a lot of pictures of him out there outside of Blackhawks&#039; practices. Shame. He&#039;s so cute!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Since I have no more dogs in this hunt, my allegiance falls in the following order: Chicago, LA, Pitt (only for Iggy), Boston.

I&#039;d also like to mention that both Oduya &#038; Westgarth are overdue for some #BeardWatch2013 love.  

But if we&#039;re going with the carb-loaded #BreadWatch mentioned above, I&#039;m #TeamSourdough all the way, baby.  :)]]></description>
