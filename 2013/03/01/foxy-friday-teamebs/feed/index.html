		<description><![CDATA[When you said Team Gagne I didn&#039;t realize you meant Sam. I thought you were picking on Simon and was gonna be like &quot;LADY, why you pickin&#039; on my Frenchie?!&quot; Sunday he and I had a fabulous convo about how he&#039;s 8 1/4 y.o. Guh! But back to the topic at hand...

Am I the only one who sees this as Ebs making his case for best future husband?

1) His dynamic warm up is him showing his dancing skills. From his old man shuffle to the right and sashaying to the left, he&#039;d be a hit at any wedding.

2)Triangle Drill = He follows directions.

3) RDL - Here, honey, I&#039;ll get those groceries.

4) The inverted rows...well, I don&#039;t need to point out the importance of thrusting with such gusto.

5) Sled push... Oh, babe, your car broke down? Let me push it 5 miles home! 

No contest. I&#039;m #TeamEbs.]]></description>

If Ebs and MG52 train there, CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT ELSE I COULD FIND?? JEEBUS. I&#039;m getting a summer job here. F*CK the day job. #TeamEbs alllllll the way. (minus anything Blackhaws or Pens, of course ;))]]></description>
