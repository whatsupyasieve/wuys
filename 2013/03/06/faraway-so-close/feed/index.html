		<description><![CDATA[The eye doctor and the facial bone doctor think that Staal will recover from the face injury fine, which is great news.  There is currently no announced timeline for his return.  But given his concussion record, there is concern that the impact of the shot could bring some of those issues back.  Obviously the last 2 points are of great concern to Rangers fans.  

On a lighter note, Nash has been an absolute stud (except for those few games he was out when the team was awful).  I am personally looking for answers as to why we wasn&#039;t at Casino Night.  Not that I was there, but I was hoping to see Nasher all dressed up with the boys.  This year the fashion was a little more understated than in previous years, but Boyle was sporting some pretty sweet purple velvet shoes. He must have some kind of Costanza-like velvet fetish - last year he was rocking a burgundy velvet jacket.

Also, Chicago: stop hogging all the wins!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OH. Also.. you are probably aware of these already, but I can&#039;t even handle all the trade rumours that are starting to surface! Are the Pens REALLY trying make a trade for Jack Johnson happen? Would Iginla accept a trade to the Pens? And if Iggy and JJ are both options for the Pens.. WHICH ONE OF HIS BROMANCES DOES SIDNEY WANT TO BE HIS NEW TEAMMATE? His Golden Goal assister or his SSM baseball and hockey buddy?

Will Alfie and Chara be reunited on the Bruins? Does anyone even want/need Luongo anymore?

SO MANY QUESTIONS.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This year&#039;s crop of rookies are great. Tarasenko, Conacher, JSchultz, Yakupov, Huberdeau, Hamilton.. just to name a few. So many potential Calder candidates! And I think it&#039;s great that it&#039;s not just the top draft picks that are getting people talking. Hopefully Tarasenko will be coming back soon from injury. He was playing so, so well for the Blues.

But the one problem with rookies.. when I remember their average age and then start feeling like Matthew McConaughey in Dazed and Confused.. &quot;That&#039;s what I like about these NHL rookies. I get older, they stay the same age.&quot;

(Big thanks to Conacher for being 23 and JSchultz for being 22 and upping the average rookie age this season.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This whole season. THIS WHOLE SEASON. I never thought I&#039;d say this but BLESS THE LOCKOUT. Because now I LOVE HOCKEY AGAIN. Now I appreciate EVERY game again. I never knew what I had before, and every moment is a blessing. I&#039;m savouring every moment because of how it was taken from us and am truly appreciative now that we have it back - it&#039;s a whole new lease on hockey life. This might be the best season EVER.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My biggest surprise has been Kaner. Patrick Kane is having an unbelievable year. Everything is coming together for him. I am one of the fortunate ones that gets to see all the Hawks games. Watching hockey has never been so much fun for a Hawks fan. These guys truly believe they can win any game. I also love that Coach Q still tells it like it is, &quot;We played terrible the first period.&quot;

I am a bit disappointed in the Oilers. They seem to be loaded with talent yet are still struggling.]]></description>
