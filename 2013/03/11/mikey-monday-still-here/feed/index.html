		<description><![CDATA[He has started tweeting and he constantly makes me cringe because he is like everyone&#039;s dad ever. When I first found out who he was, I was FLABBERGHASTED that he was not married with children because he SO has that vibe. My friend Diana loves him, not because of his arms or blue eyes, but because he looks reliable. Her fantasies about him paying the gas bill and not putting his wet towels on the floor are elaborate. And involve no sexy times. I know. 

Today he tweeted about needing someone to help him buy clothes. STOP IT Brooks Laich, unless you brough enough you for everyone.]]></description>
