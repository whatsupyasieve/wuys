		<description><![CDATA[Gotta love a hot man in a tux. Much better than a hot man in the penalty box for stupid reasons (yes, James, I mean you). My husband pointed out during the game that I &quot;correct&quot; Neal like I&#039;m scolding a child. Well, after that penalty-filled display, I have to plead guilty...

Pants, check this out, too. The boys were playing some hoops this morning. I know, I&#039;m not into basketball, either. It takes a shot of James Neal shooting 3-pointers to give me March madness...

Apparently, Nealer &#038; Duper had him really believing that they were skating around while they served. Poor guy! At least he was laughing afterward - he&#039;s got a good sense of humor. :o)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Every time the Pens play the Flyers I get really scared for James Neal&#039;s face.. because Hartnell definitely wants to break it. And then we would all REALLY hate Philly.

Does anyone else feel like while getting ready for Skates &#038; Plates the entire team just stood in front of one long mirror while James and Kris supervised and gave them all hair styling tips?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I read somewhere that the guys pranked rookie Beau Bennett, telling him that he&#039;d have to wait on tables on skates. He apparently spent the rest of the day having a mild panic attack, until he showed up for the event.

Also, Jame Neal, you&#039;re already tall and gorgeous and tall. Standing next to Tyler Kennedy was just mean.]]></description>
