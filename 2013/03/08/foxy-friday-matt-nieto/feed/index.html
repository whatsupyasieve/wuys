		<description><![CDATA[Well, I just need to chime in as another BU alum. Sadly, I&#039;ll admit I did not keep up with the team very well after I graduated, and that got even worse when I left the Boston area. As with your recent &quot;there&#039;s no time&quot; post, I find it hard enough to keep up with the NHL, and NCAA is pushed way aside. A shame.

Still have that soft spot for the Terriers, though, and I constantly annoy friends and family with &quot;DID YOU KNOW HE PLAYED AT BU?!&quot; any time one of the current NHLers is mentioned. ha.]]></description>
