		<description><![CDATA[After 2 separate trips to DC to try and [fail to] see Mr. 300 goals play with the Blue Jackets, this game was heaven.  I don&#039;t honestly know how I made it through pregame skate without hyperventilating.

As a Flyers fan, at least I had Rick Nash to redeem what was otherwise a waste of a $90 ticket.

I think I&#039;m still swooning]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Like Pooh in the honeypot&quot; - this is now going to be a staple metaphor for me.  I&#039;m also a fan of that awkward way that Nash keeps looking into the camera.  It&#039;s weird and adorable at the same time.

Last night was all kinds of outstanding.  I want to watch that game about 20 more times.  

You left out Richards&#039; 250th goal.  And it was a power play goal!  At the rate the Rangers score on the PP, Richie will get another 250 before we get another one...

With Zuccarello coming back, Boyler is slated to get some serious quality time in the press box if he doesn&#039;t step it up.

The hat last night looked a lot like last season&#039;s hat (that was lost) rather than this season&#039;s hat.  There&#039;s been much speculating around here that they may have finally found it.  Could it be that we&#039;re getting last season&#039;s mojo back??]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know who is better, Rick Nash or Jennifer Lawrence.  If I had a Patronus, I&#039;d want it to look like her.

Every time I think of the Flyers struggles, I remember that time Lindsay texted me: &quot;I want to buy a Giroux shirzee then watch them lose every single game.&quot;  That about sums it up.]]></description>
