		<description><![CDATA[... And who&#039;d have thought the Caps answer to the D-man plan would be Steve Oleksy? Maybe I caught an off day for him when the Bears played the Albany Devils, but I wasn&#039;t really buying what he was selling.
As for the answer to Sue&#039;s question of who told him that his long hair looked good, well, I&#039;m sure it&#039;s the one who assured him you can totally have hand tattoos and still look professional and that giving back to the fans is a chore. Call me crazy but he may have been injured in the past, however,  his attitude was never this bad. My advice for a healthy, er, groin, heart and head.... DITCH THE BITCH!  Ok, I think I&#039;m done.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The most unfortunate thing is that Mike is showing that he cannot stay healthy. This is not good for him, the team, his contract, etc. 

Also, whoever is telling Mike that his long hair looks good on him is an idiot. That shag needs to be cut.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Those gifs are hilarious!!! Green looks like a 10 year old bully and then Ovi falling over! How embarrassing was that?!? There are teams I hate worse than the Caps.I even pulled for them in the playoffs last season while the Pens and I &quot;took a break&quot; from our relationship for a little while. We&#039;re back together now, though! hehehe]]></description>
