		<description><![CDATA[Malkin, Letang, Kunitz, Dupuis, Morrow, Neal, Ignila.

Those guys have contributed to the Penguins&#039; success all season long but in this ECF, they just disappeared.  I&#039;m sure Pens fans are scratching their heads wondering what the heck happened.

I&#039;ll tell ya what happened.  Bruins happened.  Chara happened.  Tuukka Time happened.  :)

Here we go, Bruins! Here we go!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agreed. This is a match up that has the NHL and NBC salivating.  Two Original Six teams.  Both have one the Cup in the last 4 years. Both play very similar style of hockey.

This is going to be amazing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First off, I wish I could have done what you did and gone to a bar alone....I was alone and it sucked. Well, in the sense of having nobody to celebrate with.

I love that the puck went off Iginla&#039;s stick on that goal. It just seemed....fitting.

And I agree, this is NOT Crosby&#039;s fault. Having been virtually nonexistent didn&#039;t help his team, but it&#039;s not his fault. Malkin, Neal, and Iginla were virtually nonexistent too but you don&#039;t hear people blaming them. (at least I don&#039;t anyway). I may not like Crosby, but I still think he is (albeit a whiner) one of the best players in the world and I think he just got RIDICULOUSLY unlucky in this series. Then again...our defense is THAT.DAMN.GOOD.

Now, is it Wednesday yet???]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chuck, I felt the same way on Friday. It was my birthday, along with Lucic&#039;s, and this was the best birthday present (at this present time).  I was so overwhelmed with joy! I called it when the playoff teams were announced, I said it will be a Blackhawks/Bruins final series.  Bruins will win. 
nuff said. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After McQuaid scored on Friday that 3rd period took forever to end.  My son and I were huddled together on the couch counting down the playing time...12 more minutes, 10 more minutes, 8 more minutes, c&#039;mon! end already!  It was brutal but the B&#039;s got it done. Bring on those Hawks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s going to be an interesting (read: hair pulling, white-knuckling, screaming so loud my cats run from me) series. Tuuka and Corey have been play exceptionally well and both teams have a lot of depth.
