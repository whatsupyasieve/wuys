Bergeron jumping up and down on his skates after getting the GWG (again), the Player of the Game Army Rangers jacket, Chara saying they were winning it for Soupy, Tuukka the David-Carradine-as-Kung-Fu of goaltenders, Lucic basically laughing in Cooke&#039;s face...

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m used to being an outnumbered hockey fan in the real world, now I&#039;m experiencing it on the internet.

High fives, Chuck. You, Jana and Me: Party of Three.

I&#039;m going to feel so lonesome if there&#039;s a Hawks-Bruins final. I will obviously be cheering for the Hawks, but it will be bittersweet. Hopefully it will be a good solid series that leaves me respecting both teams at the end of it... a girl can dream.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I feel like these are the Bruins who were playing in the beginning of the season. So I&#039;m happy they&#039;ve gotten their groove back for the playoffs, because let&#039;s face it: NO ONE thought they&#039;d be up 3-0 against the Pens. 

I can&#039;t believe Campell. When he went down last night, I was yelling at the tv for the refs to blow a whistle! Hello? Man down! Man down! I&#039;ve got serious mad respect for him.

Though if there should be a Blackhawks v Bruins Stanley Cup series (which on the one hand, would be TOTALLY AWESOME with two original six teams), I don&#039;t know who I&#039;d cheer for. I&#039;ve decided that if that happens, I&#039;m going to let it come organically. 

Here&#039;s the one thing that bothers me about the picture of Bergy: It&#039;s been tampered with. Yes, he&#039;s beaten up and bruised, BUT, someone has played with the contrasting to make those cuts and bruises look deeper and worse. As someone who dabbles in photography, it bothers me. Of course I get that it&#039;s done to be dramatic, and it definitely gets the job done, but it still bothers me nonetheless.

All that said, LET&#039;S GO BRUINS!!]]></description>
