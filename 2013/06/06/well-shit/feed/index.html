		<description><![CDATA[All day, and perhaps this is the eight cups of coffee that was required to keep me upright, although probably not lucid, I&#039;ve been thinking about last night. I&#039;m a lifelong Bruins fan, but I prefer to think &quot;The Game&quot; pulls rank over individual fiefdoms. Last night was a great hockey game, and, honestly, the team that played better didn&#039;t win. It happens, but it hurts, and last night must have felt like a below-the-belt cheap shot for Pens&#039; fans. It sounds stupid now, but I&#039;ve felt it. I recall Petr Klima breaking my heart in the &#039;90 Cup Finals (double-OT as well) in a game the Bruins deserved to win. Too Many Men on the Ice in Montreal in &#039;78; Philly coming back from 0-3 down in 2010. Those stay with you for life, like freckles or annoying aunts and uncles. It&#039;s unfortunate but it&#039;s those bile-tasting, puke-inducing moments that make the triumphs pure joy. Unfortunately in sports, there are usually far more of the former than the later. But, the Pens can still win this. Perhaps, in the end, I will be the one on my knees crying out in misery. Who knows? All I know is that end of the series there will be, in the great tradition of hockey, a hand-shake line, and that is why we all belong to the Tribe of Hockey.]]></description>

PS Evidently my parents lied to me about my place of birth. Because (as my status updates tell) I&#039;m always a bit shocked we&#039;ve done so well. I mean, we&#039;re playing the PENS FFS! We choke against the Pens!]]></description>

That tightness in my chest that I&#039;ve been carrying since Saturday that I&#039;ve self-diagnosed as an anxiety attack is a little less evident. I can (sort of) breathe today.

I&#039;m listening to Nikki Yanofsky&#039;s &quot;I Believe&quot; on repeat for the next 31 hours, no shame. However Game 4 goes down, I believe in this team. Love you Pens.]]></description>

If he scored on that play, it would not have been real life.  Hollywood couldn&#039;t have scripted it any better.

As for not writing about the Bruins, you must realize that I&#039;m from New England.  And a Red Sox fan.  There is a healthy bit of self-doubt and not wanting to &quot;count our chickens before they hatch&quot; mentality.  We&#039;re afraid of the Bill Buckner Effect.

It terrifies us.]]></description>

I hope that they can pull it together and work some sort of miracle before I have a heart attack at 30.]]></description>
