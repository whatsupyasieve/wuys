		<description><![CDATA[I can definitely see Lambert&#039;s side to the situation.  But how was Campbell to know that his leg was broken?  He was probably thinking it was just a stinger and that he could skate it off like I&#039;m sure he has so many other blocked shots.  

Now knowing that the leg as in fact broken just makes the whole situation just so much more dramatic and heroic and just all-out bad ass.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One thing regarding this and the awful Lambert blog is that often, while you&#039;re in pain, you don&#039;t actually know how bad it is. The initial pain can be deceiving; it&#039;s not just that it&#039;s injured; it&#039;s how your brain interprets those signals from the site of pain. 

I know this from personal experience, when I got kicked in the thigh this past fall during hapkido (by a former hockey player, too, so it wasn&#039;t a light kick), and the way the pain hit was utterly confusing in the first several minutes. It wasn&#039;t broken; hell, on the outside, it didn&#039;t even bruise, but I also walked with a limp and had limited range of motion for 4 weeks. The pain itself was all over the place--and that was in the first minute or 2, ranging from numb to &quot;oh my god&quot; to a little bit of muscle soreness to &quot;I think I might lose my breakfast&quot; to &quot;walk it off and get right back in there for the rest of class then go grocery shopping.&quot; 

So when we talk about the heroics, yes, it was heroic--but it&#039;s also just as likely that he was doing the same thing I did and that everyone I know in a contact sport or discipline does at some point or other; not knowing quite how bad it was, trying to see if the pain would be fine after a minute or if it&#039;s indeed a trip to the hospital, running on crazy endorphins, yes. So maybe not quite  heroic so much as practical, and not nearly as stupid as Lambert thinks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you haven&#039;t already watched it, go to Bruins.com and watch the video of Campbell when Bish went to visit him over last summer. It&#039;s really great! He&#039;s so soft-spoken and it shows how different these players can be once they put their skates on. Plus, if I remember correctly, he was wearing nerdy, hipster glasses and pink pants rolled up. So cute. 

About the Lambert piece on Yahoo: I guess I can see both sides. Doing what he did shouldn&#039;t be expected of him (in the NHL or any other sport), but the fact that he did it, I think it&#039;s fair to say we&#039;ve all got mad respect for him and that should be commended. He wasn&#039;t thinking of himself--even if he should&#039;ve been (and no one would&#039;ve respected him less if he&#039;d just laid down on the ice--Hello? Broken leg!?). He was thinking about the team. And THAT is the teachable moment, as Chuck so eloquently wrote.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My life partner aka boyfriend is a huge Philly sports fan. (Ugh!), he&#039;s been mentioning how our future children will be Philly fans like him (nope), I will show them of the good side. The resiliency of the team after Horton&#039;s concussion and bringing &#039;Boston ice,&#039; to Vancouver, to Bergy&#039;s clutch-ness, to Soupy&#039;s resiliency. Never, ever give up. #BostonStrong]]></description>
