		<description><![CDATA[I, too, am saddened by the fact that there were no wild adventuress for Giroux and Biz.  Oh, the shenanigans that could have ensued, but, alas, will never be.  Maybe next year.  I never understood why the Flyers traded away Bob.  And Bryz might be out the door.  If Mason flops, we got nothing.  Don&#039;t get me started about their defense.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I almost made a PKane note too, because he&#039;s little and supports the St. Loius stereotype.  But mostly because it&#039;s hilarious for Kaner to be so sportsman like on the ice and so festively/aggressively intoxicated at other times.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Even though I was denied getting to see Jon win the Selke in person in 2011, no formal awards show this year did mean getting to see him give his acceptance speech in shorts. And what shorts they were! (Still doesn&#039;t make up for his Hart snub... East Coast bias! 4th place out of 700-something ain&#039;t bad I guess.). It&#039;s also worth noting that PKane was second for the Lady Byng. Oh the jokes!

Can we please also address the fact that Ovi is eating caviar in that picture? And we will NOT discuss the fact that you have managed to find a picture of him that kinda does it for me. I blame the pastries.

The field trip to the 2014 Awards is on, yes? It&#039;ll also be Amanda&#039;s 21st and I promised her male exotic dancers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two things:
- That gif of Jake? My forever reaction to Ovi winning the Hart. Sorry I&#039;m not sorry but I just cannot accept this. I&#039;d take Tavares, even on the Islanders.

- Sid....your hair. Now that you&#039;ve shown just what a long post-season can do...that&#039;s like a damn glamour shot. RIP.]]></description>
