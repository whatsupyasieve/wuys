		<description><![CDATA[Wait - you&#039;re telling me that ISN&#039;T Tom Hardy? UNCANNY.

I don&#039;t know much about Bruins lore, so I can&#039;t rank the appropriateness of the casting but any time cute boys play hockey, I can&#039;t complain. 

Anecdote! When Wyatt played in Canada, Kurt and Goldie shipped at the deli my friend worked and she said Goldie was as delightful as you would hope. I adore her. In fact, I just rewatched Private Benjamin. These are the things I do without hockey in my life.]]></description>
