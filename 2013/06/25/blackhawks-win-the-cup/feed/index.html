		<description><![CDATA[I cannot believe this is even real life. Still. It all happened so quickly - I thought we were going to game 7 as then.....Bickell. Bolland. BOOM. Glitter cupcakes.

I will say - Patrice. I did not like you throughout the entire playoffs because you effectively ENDED EVERYTHING. But you, sir, are a warrior. I cannot wait for Sochi to cheer you on.

Jonathan....you came through again. Killed it with fire. Made everything better. Danced on the B. And I can&#039;t wait to see what you do this summer. Love these guys.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If it couldn&#039;t be the Pens, at least it wasn&#039;t the Bruins. The Hawks are my #3 also, and I still haven&#039;t recovered from last night. Between the Blue Jackets, the Pens, and the Hawks, I&#039;m exhausted. For a season that didn&#039;t start unti January, it seemed to last forever.

It was glorious.

I will concede that Patrice Bergeron is a beautiful, beautiful man.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t cry over the Super Bowl (not even the time I went). I&#039;ve never seen the World Series, and I just saw my first NBA final the other day (unimpressed). The Stanley Cup, however, makes me blubber like an infant, regardless of who wins it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The best thing about this is all of the dancing.  Tazer moonwalking, Q doing the little shake thing with the cup.  More hockey dancing please.

But now that it&#039;s over, and the Blackhawks won, I can say I&#039;m a little sad that there will not be more naked celebrating Tyler Seguin pictures on tumblr.

But I will console myself with unbuttoned blue shirt Toews.

		<description><![CDATA[As a huge fan of both teams--I love them equally--I opted to root for the Blackhawks because they had such an amazing season, and I wanted it to end with the Cup. I&#039;m ecstatic that it did! What an amazing ride!

That said, I&#039;m proud of the Bruins. They had one HELL of a playoff run. I will never forget watching game 7 against Toronto! And no one thought they&#039;d win against the Pens, let alone sweep them. 

Both teams have a lot of heart and depth and each should be proud of the way they played. I know that doesn&#039;t help the Bruins who aren&#039;t hoisting the Cup, but it does mean something to this fan who knows they gave it everything they had.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While I feel bad for some of the Bruins player&#039;s I&#039;m glad that Jeremy Jacobs didn&#039;t win the cup in a lockout year that he helped cause.

Also that shot of Duncan Keith and his baby should be used in fertility clinics as an ovulation aid.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tazer moonwalking is everything.  I can&#039;t stand it.  Also, Duncan Keith with his baby &#038; Patrick Sharp with his daughter were just too much.

I do feel badly for Bergeron, though.  I hate the Bruins, but that beautiful man has the heart of a lion.]]></description>
