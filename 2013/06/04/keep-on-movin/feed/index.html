		<description><![CDATA[Brian!  Your voice of reason is welcome here, I need someone to sound more sane about it than I do!  I agree on TK, I&#039;d really like to see him tomorrow night.  He plays hard, if not always elegantly, and is one of the few Pens who doesn&#039;t seem to go down the drain when Crosby gets cranky.  (Sorry Sid.)]]></description>

Does he have a brother?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey, not to encourage the opposition here, but this is far from over. Think BU-Miami (OH) in the &#039;09 title game. Nothing is ever over until, well, it is....However, your boy Bylsma might want to reassess his roster moves and go with more skill (TK) and less brawn (JV/ love the Beanpot lads, but he&#039;s not going to do much against the Bs). Also, some strong coffee and T-Anthony pizza has been known to revive the dead, of which the Pens have many. If all else fails, there&#039;s always JW Black.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just keep reminding myself: This season they&#039;ve won fifteen in a row. They&#039;ve won seven in a row. They&#039;ve won five in a row. Four in a row or four out of five is not impossible for this team when they&#039;re playing the right way. 

And to steal Lindsay&#039;s sentiment from last night..

		<description><![CDATA[My hope is basically gone. I swear on my grave that i will not watch the next game because i am convinced that since i watched the first two games, i am a curse and jinx. If the Pens win in game 3 without me watching, then so help me God, i am a curse to my favorite team :/]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with you: going to channel all positive energy their way, even though they seem to have suddenly forgotten what it is they do for a living. I have faith that they can figure it out in time. Meanwhile, I&#039;m trying to keep a zen front (I can&#039;t be crying up in the workplace).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mr. Pants, the best. Even my hubs took pity on me last night and left me alone after the game. Sadness.

As for the Hawks/Pens vortex...PANTS YOU READ MY MIND! What the h*ll Blackhawks?! I&#039;ve actually started carrying Tums with me at all times because I can&#039;t handle this stress. The back and forth is too much.

And I will do my best to join you on this rainbow creation mission. Positivity, here we come! ....right??]]></description>
