		<description><![CDATA[I had the same exact feeling when the wings were knocked out after that last intense game 7 in Chicago- honestly watching Zetterberg&#039;s post game interview made me want to shut down my computer and tv until hockey stopped existing.

I&#039;m not neccessarily a huge Pens fan, but god when you post all these pictures of James Neal in short sleeves and such well fitting pants, it&#039;s difficult to hate him. So I genuinely thank you for that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are a woman who is finally seeing the error of her ways. For so long, you denied the tattoos and the hockey flow, but girl, you just have to let it go.  

Accept it.  Embrace it.  Celebrate it.  I&#039;ve been doing it for so long and I&#039;m so much happier for it.
