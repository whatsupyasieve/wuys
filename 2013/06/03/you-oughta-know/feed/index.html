		<description><![CDATA[Not just Bergy&#039;s face: he shouldn&#039;t have grabbed Bergy&#039;s about the neck and dragged him backwards. Plus he threw the first punch.

Officiating may have been all over the joint, but there&#039;s no need for that from either side frankly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am a very loyal Capitals fan; however, when they get knocked out of the playoffs I do cheer on other teams. That being said I have chosen to cheer on Boston since it would be wrong for me to cheer on the Penguins; however, because of this blog I have felt torn about my choice. I honestly think Crosby is very talented but he is not what is making this difficult. It is the fact that this blog has made me like Letang and Neal. I would never have paid attention to them before. Also, I cheer on all Czech players since I lived in the Czech Republic for a bit so I wanted to cheer on Vokoun, but alas I would feel as if I am betraying by number one team the Capitals so Boston it is. Also, the city of Boston needs something to cheer for. I love your blog but it has now made a simple choice not so simple!!!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure I even want to comment on this. What do you say? &quot;Hold my earrings and teach me how to fight that twerp Marchand?&quot; That&#039;s the PG version of what I screamed when he took down Neal. UGGGGGGHHHHHHHH.

The fact is when the Penguins get angry, they lose. Here&#039;s to hoping they took some tranquilizers today that allow them to focus on what&#039;s really important - putting pucks in the net. You can&#039;t win if you don&#039;t score.

Oh, and thanks to Alison for this. Always and forever. http://24.media.tumblr.com/475b2193f67d78df2a910a6893b946e2/tumblr_mnrxayjYKv1rf0fpjo1_400.gif]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This Pens/Bruins series is going to give me a nervous breakdown, and I don&#039;t even root for either team. The officiating was all over the place and then Crosby is all up in Tuukka&#039;s face and it felt like a replay of Toew&#039;s Penalty Box Tour was just waiting to happen again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When Sid bumped Rask after the period, I thought &quot;that was kind of an unnecessary d--k move.&quot;  When he got in Chara&#039;s face (chest, really, but why nitpick), I yelled, &quot;WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?!&quot;  Beyond trying to win this game and this series, Z could end Sid&#039;s career without evening meaning to, given the size differential and Sid&#039;s medical history.  NOT SMART, kiddo.  Someone needs to calm these guys down, because there&#039;s no reason for them not to be beating the Bruins.

And Geno: LEAVE BERGY&#039;S FACE ALONE! Just cuz you&#039;re jealous, doesn&#039;t mean you need it ruin it for the rest of us.]]></description>
