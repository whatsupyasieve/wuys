		<description><![CDATA[I look at the SCF this way...
I do like Chicago-so that makes it a LITTLE easier-and they did have a craaaaazyyyyy beginning of the season. They were amazing. I just, like you said, wish the game was 58 minutes that night instead of 60....
BUT, the Bruins had this unbelievable story book playoff season, without the story book ending. Either way it&#039;s heartbreaking...I refused to watch the interviews, I couldn&#039;t handle it. And I have admittedly cried over Ference more than once...And let&#039;s add the punctured lung to Bergeron&#039;s list of injuries...I just UGHHHH. The Cup should be in Boston after everything that went on... :(
Congratulations to the Blackhawks though. Incredible run for them. And a new respect as well for that full page ad they took out in the Globe. More than that, I am SO proud of the Bruins fans that were in attendance for not only chanting &quot;let&#039;s go Bruins&quot; and continuing their support for the team even AFTER they lost, but for being SO respectful of the Blackhawks getting the Cup. Did you see the picture of the guy wearing a Bergeron jersey taking a picture of a bunch of kids in Blackhawks gear on the ice? He was smiling. It was adorable!!! and now I&#039;m getting all misty eyed again....damn.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a Leafs fan, I know the feels. I too wish games were only 58 minutes. But all the respect in the world to Bergeron, I&#039;m surprised they didn&#039;t hold him together with duct tape. The Bruins played well and you have a recent cup to celebrate and a SCF appearance. 
Still my condolences. It may take weeks to get over, and when you think you are and sitting by yourself, enjoying lunch, you&#039;ll hear yourself say, &quot;If only they had held on for another minute or so.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a huge fan of both teams, so imagine my glee and dread in knowing they&#039;d face off each other in the SCF. It was like hitting the lottery and going bankrupt in the same day!

It was a tough loss for the Bs, but I knew the Blackhawks would win the series (though I thought it would be in seven games). 

The Bruins had strength. The Blackhawks had speed. 

The Bruins had Tuuka, but the Blackhawks had Toews, Kane, Sharp, Hossa, Bickell, Seabs and on and on. 

But all season, the Bruins gave up third period leads like it was nobody&#039;s business, and all season, the Blackhawks were comeback kings.

Bottom line: It was a hard fought series. Had to be one of the best, right? Both teams have much to be proud of and I know I&#039;m looking forward to October and watching these two teams meet up again in the regular season.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with Pants. I think my hate for the Bruins is even stronger than a million suns. I was THRILLED to see them watch someone else lift a Cup on their ice. But you do have a recent Cup so hold onto that. It&#039;s more than most have. As a Kings fan that&#039;s what I did when the Hawks beat us.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll be the first to admit (right behind Pants) that I am not a fan of the Bruins, but I am proud of that team.  

Gregory Campbell&#039;s heroics will never be forgotten, and I have no words for Bergeron.  I can&#039;t fathom what it took for him to get out there for game 6 and play for that...not for himself, but so he could contribute all he could to his team.  That is dedication (mixed with a little bit of stupidity, perhaps).  I hope he is well soon.

It&#039;s heartbreaking to see your team go down like that (been there, done that), but be proud because they left it all on the ice and they never gave up.  

Hugs to you all, B&#039;s fans]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Monday was horrible on all levels. I had to work late thus missing the entire game. As superstitious as I am, I knew if I didn&#039;t watch any of it the odds were, we were going to lose. Being a part of cybear, and having the mobile app-I got all the alerts, and when I saw 3-2, I tried to hold my composure but it didn&#039;t work. When I got home, my boyfriend said I&#039;m sorry, (as a Philly fan he knows of losses more than anyone else I know). All I did was nod my head with tears in my eyes. I&#039;m normally  talkative and I have been really  quiet, trying to come to terms with the loss with a heavy heart. I too cannot watch/nor read any post game interviews/blogs yet, and I&#039;m not sure when I will be able to. I am so undeniably proud of our team, but wished the outcome was different.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;ve summed it up perfectly. It still hurts thinking of what could have been, but deep down inside I&#039;m proud of the B&#039;s for how far they came. Not ready to start shouting &quot;OMFG, is it October yet?!&quot;, but gimmie a few more days. :)]]></description>
