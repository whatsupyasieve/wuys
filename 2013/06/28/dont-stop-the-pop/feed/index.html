		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sunburnt, sore, and exhausted having been up since 3, but it was all totally worth to got to Chicago to see the Victory Rally! The speeches (Sharp, Shaw, Kane, Crawford, Toews, Keith) were all epic, especially Crawford&#039;s!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Danny B has said his kids are staying in South Jersey.  They consider it home now so if he plays, it will be a team close by I think. It doesn&#039;t leave a lot of options. So the bromance between my two favorite boys will still be on but not to the same degree. I sure hope they can make it work. ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You also missed:

- Chris Kunitz&#039;s new deal
- Viktor Stalberg probably not returning to the Hawks
- The Hawks buying out Olesz and Montador (the glasses!)
- Dave Bolland trade rumours

AND THAT WAS JUST YESTERDAY. Seriously, if this is ALL before: the draft, free agency frenzy AND the rest of the off-season, Imma have to bring alcohol to the office to survive until October.

Other thoughts: Poor Vinny, even if he&#039;s walking away with a suitcase full of cash; good luck Alex, the Flames weren&#039;t doing you any favours and our rink might not be ready after the floods; Kris...I&#039;m so mad; Danny...want a job with the Pens or Hawks? I could learn to love you.

Damn, I need a nap and it&#039;s only 9:30 here. Back to the Hawks parade.]]></description>
