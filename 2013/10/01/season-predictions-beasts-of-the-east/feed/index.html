		<description><![CDATA[I miss the old days, when things were simple. One to eight, match ups determined. Now we have to think about the realignment and it ain&#039;t just the top eight anymore. 

Now it&#039;s all about your Division - playoffs will really be based on how you rank in the Atlantic or Metropolitan or wherever you&#039;re based. The top three teams in each take up the top 12 spots, and the remaining spots are allocated to &quot;Wild Cards.&quot; Two for each conference, based on the highest-placed finishers, based on regular-season points - doesn&#039;t matter which division you&#039;re in.

This article was very helpful, since I&#039;m allergic to all math besides &quot;half your age plus seven&quot;:

		<description><![CDATA[I love how you two went Bs/Pens and Pens/Bs.  My predictions for the East:

1. Bruins - As much as it kills me, they&#039;re mostly unchanged and obnoxiously good. Please let Marchand go on a Desperately Seeking Seguin bender.
2. Senators - Bobby is way better than Alfie and the Sens will want to prove him wrong.
3. Pens - See Bruins comment.  Please let Flower wilt.
4. Rangers - They&#039;re #1 in my heart, but probably not in the conference. I want Cally &#038; Hags back ASAP and PLEASE GOD let the preseason not be indicative of what&#039;s to come this season.
5. Blue Jackets - I think this team is only getting started. Bob will be just as good this season.
6. Islanders - See Jackets comment. JT wins the Hart this season.
7. Habs - This is of course contingent on Price, but I love their young kids and they showed last year they can tough it out.
8. Capitals - The team is mostly the same, but I don&#039;t think they&#039;ll get much higher than this because they have way more games against tougher teams this year, so they&#039;ll get fewer easy points.
Sleeper: Lightning - Overall it&#039;s not a lot to look at on paper, but if Stammer &#038; Marty are hot again and their goaltending is better than expected, I think they have a shot at the last playoff spot in the East.]]></description>
