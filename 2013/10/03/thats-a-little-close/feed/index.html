		<description><![CDATA[Just wondering if you ladies saw the picture of Crosby with  the sniper rifle. A lot of women seemed fond of it.

Those pants are a miracle of engineering.

I wasn&#039;t upset about the DMV thing--nobody needed to be held up by fans trying to get autographs and pictures--but now that I know he also got a good license picture, I&#039;m starting to feel a bit resentful.

I really, really, really hope Neal isn&#039;t off the ice for too long.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a little sad that I remember this, but I&#039;m among friends here: Crosby&#039;s trainer has talked about how exceptionally good his vision is. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.anguscertified.com/an-interview-with-fitness-guru-andy-obrien/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) So, no glasses for him unless you want to wait until he&#039;s in his 40s or see him wear windowpanes.]]></description>

Well, then we&#039;ll have to continue to hope that we can get Nealmobile in his glasses and savor the ones of Paulie in his. :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[And I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s super creepy on my part, but I noticed that on Sid&#039;s license there is a restriction. So of course I watched over and over to see if I could tell what it is; and I think that I found this:  	

1: License holder must wear corrective lenses when driving (glasses/contacts)

Maybe this is not news, I just didn&#039;t know that Sid might wear glasses or contacts. :)]]></description>
