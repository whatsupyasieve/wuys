		<description><![CDATA[I am so upset about Moulson, I didn&#039;t know JT was his daughter&#039;s godfather, ugh. Every time they trade a player it seems to be a bad idea, go figure, Moulson had I think 2 goals in his first game in Buffalo, not to mention just looking at stats, he&#039;s been better than Vanek the last three seasons, but I digress, this is just another example of  the Islanders&#039; inability make proper life choices.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I finally downloaded Sharp magazine after a nap on Friday, when I&#039;d taken the day off. Watched the behind the scenes video and practically DISSOLVED INTO ATOMS - $2.99 is a bargain deal for porn, ladies. My god. I didn&#039;t know walking and elevator music and suits and leg shots could be so incredible. 

&quot;Now I spilled Coke all over my shirt.&quot; Correct, Steven.]]></description>
