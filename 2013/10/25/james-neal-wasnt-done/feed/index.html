		<description><![CDATA[This is the school district where I grew up, and where my mom still works.  One of the other teachers sent her a link to the video, which she forwarded to me with the note &quot;I think James Neal is involved,&quot; and when I opened the email I said &quot;HOLY CRAP&quot; out loud.

So... No real point to that story except that I&#039;m at work making that same Jennifer Lawrence face and wondering why this didn&#039;t happen when I was a kid.]]></description>
