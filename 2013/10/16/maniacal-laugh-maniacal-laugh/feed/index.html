		<description><![CDATA[Sucks that the Capitals didn&#039;t beat the Rangers, but at least they won against the Blue Jackets. I didn&#039;t get to watch the game so I&#039;m really sad I missed getting to see this.

		<description><![CDATA[Personally, I think my Bruins could be doing better, especially since we&#039;ve been promised a better power play and have some talented new faces, but I will continue to be hopeful. I&#039;m really happy that the Hurricanes are doing really well (how &#039;bout that Intern of yours?)and hope that they continue to do well throughout the season.

My friend Nate is a Devils fan and he&#039;s been taking bets on twitter on how many shootout rounds their game against the Rangers on Saturday is going to take for someone to win. 

I also feel a sense of justice around the Flyers being last in the Eastern Conference.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a Leafs fan so I am wavering between wildly happy and waiting for the other shoe (*cough*Clarkson) to drop. It&#039;s not like we haven&#039;t seen it before. 

I also feel bad for the poor wee Oiler boys. They deserve a couple of nice wins. Won&#039;t somebody think of the children?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can NOT deny that I love seeing Philly at the bottom of the entire Conference! Just hope our boys can skate into the Wells Fargo tomorrow night &#038; do what they&#039;re pretty good at doing there - WIN. 

Anyone see an update on Dan Boyle yet today? That was a NASTY hit &#038; I&#039;m praying that LaPierre gets Shanabanned for a LONG time!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[HAHAHA!  I feel exactly the same way about Philly! I felt a little bad for taking joy from their misery but man I hate that team.  But not more than Boston.  Sorry Chuck.  It&#039;s still very early but my Leafs are off to a surprisingly great start.  The Pens are awesome as always and Crosby is rolling.  The only team I feel bad for is the Oilers.  Poor puppies!  The Avs are surprising everyone.  The Sharks are dominating too but they also started off that way last year....  Oh man, I am loving the season so far and pretty amped for Pens/Flyers Thursday night.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This hurts, Pants. This really hurts. As a Rangers fan and a Giants fan, this is pretty much as bad as my life as a sports fan has ever been.  I don&#039;t even have the right words to adequately capture the bleakness.

So, uh, Sharpy just had another kid.  That&#039;s nice.

Yep, that&#039;s pretty much all I&#039;ve got.  That, and vodka.]]></description>
