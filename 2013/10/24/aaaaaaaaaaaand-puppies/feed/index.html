		<description><![CDATA[I was actually there with the Animal Rescue League, Geno wanted puppies &quot;that would kiss him&quot;  He actually LOVES puppies.  These guys were so nice and pleasant, and so willing to help the animals.  It was a great two days of shooting, the calendar in the past has been beautiful and this year&#039;s will be no different!  Go Pens and Go ARL!!!]]></description>

Dear James Neal, does it buy points with you that I have a white French Bulldog who was a rescue?  Will you come to my house and take him for a walk?  If Nealer, Sunshine and Geno brings all the rescue puppies in Pittsburgh to my house, I&#039;ll adopt them.  I&#039;m buying 10,000 copies of this calendar and plastering it everywhere I am.]]></description>
