		<description><![CDATA[Oh Lisa, I was there tonight.  I saw this in real time, life speed in which it didn&#039;t even look like Mike was attempting a check.  Just appeared to go straight over the boards like a puppy through a dog door.  Possibly the highlight of my hockey-related life.  Big round of applause for MG52.  This is getting it&#039;s own post tomorrow because I can&#039;t live without it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thought you guys would enjoy this though it&#039;s totally unrelated to this post except perhaps in the category of &quot;things that make you wince.&quot; This one is mostly from secondhand embarrassment though.

		<description><![CDATA[I wondered that myself (and hoped so), plus there&#039;s no blood in this gif/video.  But it reads on Puck Daddy like they were real teeth, not fake, and there was blood at some point that  don&#039;t see here. http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/john-tavares-plays-amateur-dentist-pulls-own-tooth-015413102--nhl.html  

This could be wrong because maybe not everyone remembers everything that happens to John Tavares the way we do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John, after your dentist appointment I need some accounting advice. 

The neck biting gets me. Who does that Swiss player think he is, a vampire?? Hockey players, man. Don&#039;t let anyone tell you this isn&#039;t the toughest sport out there. Or you can bite them (but don&#039;t, probably not a good idea).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I saw a reporter on Twitter say that the teeth he lost in the game were the fake ones he got after the pre-training camp teeth incident. Not sure if it was ever confirmed or not. 

This is an important question that needs answering. Someone get Pants media accreditation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is post-teeth-losing video! http://www.msg.com/videos/index.html?vid=2411723911

He has a little lisp, which makes me feel slightly better about how incredibly bad we&#039;ve played the last couple games.

I&#039;m not over the fact that hockey medics have black gloves so they don&#039;t lose all the teeth they end up holding. :&#124;&#124;&#124;&#124;]]></description>
