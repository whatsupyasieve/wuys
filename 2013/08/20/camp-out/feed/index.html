		<description><![CDATA[I should write a very impassioned letter to Hallsy asking why he does not have the time to attend Camp BioSteel because the lack of Hallsy this summer is making me NUTS. 
MAYBE the Oilers would be doing better if Hallsy was attending Camp. MAYBE. 
I&#039;m done.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That hair... Mmmmm. Perfect. Run my hands through it length. Right girls?  Still juuuust long enough for a twirl around the finger...? Sigh... I&#039;m in love. Definitely. If only I could have been a mouse in the corner the day he cut it so as to steal a lock for myself. (Oooh, is that borderline creepy? Did I say that out loud?) Well, I&#039;m sure his mama must be relieved that he looks nice and clean cut now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been staring at the BioSteel stuff since yesterday! Thanks for making it easier -- all in one place. Especially James and his (annual and overdue) back-to-school haircut. At this rate, I may not survive until the big game on Thursday! :)]]></description>
