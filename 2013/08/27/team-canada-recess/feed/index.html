		<description><![CDATA[I won&#039;t even be mad if Canada wins gold again with this group.. I&#039;ll just watch curling instead and cheer for the US so I technically won&#039;t be reducing the number of events that I&#039;m actively cheering for the USA in. But, uh guys. Question of the day- is James Neal really getting married?!?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This. Made. My. Week!!! Thanks, Lindsey &#038; Alison, for your brave sacrifices on our behalf! Hah!! 

Pants, I could not STOP laughing at your captions - you&#039;re letting your comedic brilliance out to play as usual. Thank you!!

Not going to lie - I definitely &quot;borrowed&quot; 2 pictures from this post to use as wallpaper (either desktop or phone - maybe both!) and neither is the Sid golfing one. Ya&#039;ll know I love that Gingerbeard also known as Nealmobile, so I had to have some. :)

Can&#039;t wait for more!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In defense of Lucic, he doesn&#039;t have bad posture, he has scoliosis or some junk. And was very nice to me when I asked for a picture even though he and his wife were clearly trying to leave. 

Enought about that... I had almost forgotten how MUCH I love Toews (like not the fact, but the FEELS), but I have spent the last two days FLAILING. So everything is status quo.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would just like to say that, even as a Bruins fan, I love the &quot;No rose for you&quot; for Lucic....mainly because I can&#039;t stand him....
And OMG Toews! love love love!

Aside from that, even though I&#039;m Team USA, (almost) all of my favorite players are from Canada and ugh, they&#039;re all so gorgeous. I&#039;m a bad American....]]></description>
