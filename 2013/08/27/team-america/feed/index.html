		<description><![CDATA[I went! I have a bunch of photos, but they are all pretty bad quality, as they were taken through netting during the intro ceremony. 

I got there super late because 295 was a friggin parking lot, so I didn&#039;t get to meet a bunch of the players who mingled earlier on. (I am devastated about not getting to meet Paul Martin or Beau Bennett) 

I got to meet Yandle and Broshie, though! They were super sweet and Broshie is seriously as pretty irl and up close as he is in pictures. (Sadly, I didn&#039;t get any pics of meeting them)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alert: Maybe it came after this was posted, or maybe you just didn&#039;t see it, but there&#039;s some Team USA video up on NHL.com, and I also saw some stuff on individual team sites - featured interviews with their own potential US Olympians and the like. Off the top of my head, the Pens and Wild both had two tabs of their little home-page slideshow things devoted to Team USA, and no Canada!

Haven&#039;t done the cross-referencing to see how much the NHL site differs from the team-specific stuff, but... it&#039;s maybe a start?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a nice piece in today&#039;s Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on  Paul Martin: http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/sports/olympics/penguins-martin-still-chasing-his-olympic-dream-700860/ (Super cute pic from his first bid doesn&#039;t hurt, either.)

Would love to see this smart, steady D finally get his shot, especially after his struggles a couple years ago and how hard he worked to return to form in Pittsburgh. A gold medal for Team USA, perhaps followed by a Stanley Cup for the Penguins a few months later, wouldn&#039;t be a bad high point to that redemption story...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have total faith in Team USA, even though I *HATE* their jerseys (they look like something Ralph Lauren would design after he&#039;d had a stroke). Team chemistry is everything (along with pluckiness &#038; heart), and Team USA has it in spades.

Are they accepting applications for curfew/bed check monitors?  Otherwise, I&#039;m happy to volunteer to be a WUYS Team USA correspondent.  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have to admit the best thing about Team USA is the gif of Riley in National Treasure.  I shouted, &quot;Albuquerque! Snorkel!&quot;

I like these guys, but not enough to drive the entire 14 minutes from my office to Kettler.  Maybe on a weekend, but I&#039;m away next weekend, and... perhaps this is the truest American support I can give Team USA, one based on my inherent laziness and overwhelming desire to vacation.

Remember, I got in trouble last Olympics for my reaction to Crosby&#039;s Golden Goal.  I don&#039;t intend to contain myself this time around either.]]></description>
