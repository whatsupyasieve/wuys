		<description><![CDATA[Great post, Pants!! I adore Crosby too....took a stroll around the office and reminded everyone on Wednesday that it was Crosby&#039;s birthday! Age is not discussed on this board right.:)  I attend Pens games and almost fell over the railing in an attempt to receive a high five from 87 but the person I was with did receive that high five! Sid is a great person as well as hockey player. He does many charitable acts in Pittsburgh without media fanfare and hype for which I give him a lot of a credit.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I actually had to walk around the beach to get service so I could check out your post, Pants!  Sid is deliciously awkward, talented and all things hockey to me.  Hope you had a great birthday #87, because the female hockey fan-base are damn glad you were born!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This maybe possibly prompted me to to go and watch all the SportChek French version commercials. (The job interview one? DEAD.) 

And then the tomato sandwich one. (The mayo is RIGHT THERE, Sid.)

And then YouTube recommended the he Dempster&#039;s commercial. And the Tim Horton&#039;s commercial that always makes everyone cry.

Okay.. it&#039;s 11:00am I need to get my productivity back on track..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just *randomly* happened to be touching my hair like that Ariel gif when I scrolled through this post. Consider it the Crosby touch! (like that video that was posted yesterday. The Crosby touch...)

Pants I think the only thing missing here is his en Francais abilities? The ones that leave us all (Alison) on the cold, hard ground? Perfect, Sid, as usual. Happy birthday - to another great year!]]></description>
