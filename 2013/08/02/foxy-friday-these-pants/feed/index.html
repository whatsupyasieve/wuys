		<description><![CDATA[Nah. Forgive Stammer for he knows not what he does. Look at him carefully, children. See him radiating there?  Hands so deftly placed on his hips?  Mmmmmm. That&#039;s some goooood shit. I&#039;ve got sunglasses. Will wear. Will hide my smile as I see the imprint of his navel in that gleaming white shirt. I bet it hides the big old &#039;S&#039; on his chest.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;pluot season is almost over&quot; &#060;-- PANTS I love you so much. I had to educate someone in my office about what boyfriend jeans, peplum AND cage heels are. FFS. 

Back to the boys. I&#039;m with @ceej. More ink and less hats on James - like THIS: https://twitter.com/Spit69/status/362749583085940737/photo/1

As for you, Steven, I don&#039;t even know what to say. Good thing you&#039;re so adorable. I&#039;ve forgiven you already for having burned my retinas from your neon pants.]]></description>
