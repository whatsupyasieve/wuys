		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s only a mere 97 miles from good ole Burlington, VT to Montreal. Time spent at the border for having a French middle and last name takes roughly 2.5 hours if you&#039;re like me... if you&#039;re Americanized, probably a good hour to the border, another half hour to Montreal. But, what&#039;s that you say? There aren&#039;t any worthy sports teams in Montreal? It&#039;s only 6 hours to Toronto and three to Ottawa! :) chasing Canadian hockey players since 1987....]]></description>

SHAME.]]></description>
