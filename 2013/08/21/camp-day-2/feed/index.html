		<description><![CDATA[Wow, thanks ladies. I&#039;m pretty good at finding all things Neal, but you had some new ones here (and a BIG round of applause to Lindsay for the tv photo, I thought only I did that kind of thing! I took a picture of Neal on the scoreboard at Consol during a post-game interview and I thought my husband was just going to walk away and leave me on the spot...) I&#039;m not too sure about the tattoo, but the hedgehog hair and the scruff...I can&#039;t resist that. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For once, I&#039;m going to say stop with the tattoos because I&#039;m getting the best of both worlds - half sleeve on one side, inner bicep tat on the other. Pretty sure that is the hottest tattoo placement of all time.

Hal Gill is one of my favorite guys. Giant, funny, cute - ideal wedding date material. I hope he finds a team soon!]]></description>
