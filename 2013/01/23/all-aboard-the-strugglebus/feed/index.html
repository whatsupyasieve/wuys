		<description><![CDATA[Got room for one more? We on the Flyers bus know it&#039;s not Bryz&#039;s fault although last one on the ice and first one off at pracy doesn&#039;t send a good message. Their other major problem? No pre-season means no trying out line combos.  When you lose a major player from almost every line on your team, finding the right chemistry is key. This is a problem the Flyers, Hurricanes, and Rangers are all suffering from. With no time to test the D-pairings and forward lines, we&#039;re witnessing the experimenting on game day.  It also would have behooved some of these teams to scrimmage ::cough cough:: Philly. I have hope for all of them yet.  

SIDE NOTE: Coach Oates, if you could please return Mr. Kundratek to the Bears the weekend of February 23-24 for the game vs. the Albany Devils in A.C. I would much appreciate it. In these harrowing times we try to hold on to as much eye candy as possible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t think Carle was that much of a loss but I am rethinking my thoughts on that.  And stupid penalties is an understatement.  The Simmonds one was the worst.  Doesn&#039;t matter if he did&#039;t hit Broduer that hard.  You touch him, you&#039;re going to the box. Period.  I love my boys especially Giroux and Briere(we need back him in the lineup) but they need to right this ship.  And now Schenn was suspended for a game.  Great....though I think the Shanaban is appropriate for the hit.  I am trying to be positive but the Rangers game really better wake them up or I am going to be cursing more than I usually do when I watch them play.  0-4 is NOT what I want.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been watching them &#039;cause I&#039;m a die-hard Flyers fan and I absolutely agree with you. Shaky on the blue line (missing Matt Carle more than they expected, still missing Pronger) and missing Jaromir Jagr and Danny Briere&#039;s leadership. And the dumb penalties. Ugh. Don&#039;t get me started on the dumb penalties. As a born and bred Flyers fan I love and appreciated hard, legal hits and calling a guy out and dropping the gloves WHEN APPROPRIATE but taking stupid penalties Grrrr. Absolutely 100% time and place and that was neither the time nor the place. Voracek, Simmonds, Coburn, Hartnell, and Giroux all took some really stupid, stupid penalties last night and had I not been watching in a public place with friends I would have been swearing loudly. I know, not lady like, but stupid penalties push my buttons.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been hate-watching the Flyers, just be cause I can (thanks, Center Ice!), and it seems like it&#039;s not so much Bryz being bad as it is their blueline being reeeeeeeal shaky. And a lot of just DUMB penalties and fights. Like really, what was Simmonds trying to accomplish by pushing Brodeur last night? I get that you&#039;re frustrated but, c&#039;mon guys, time and place.

But like I said, I&#039;m hate-watching them, so obviously my opinions are not fair and balanced, haha.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bearing in mind that training camp was barely there before they went back on the ice, not to mention a lot of the guys have been playing overseas with different teams for the experience, I think this is to be expected.  I equally think it is really frustrating for fans.

Let&#039;s give it a few weeks - there have been some major roster changes and these guys haven&#039;t had a chance to gel properly as teams.  The notable exception to the rule is Boston, but they didn&#039;t make many changes to their team, so they know each other pretty well.

Also, I&#039;m a die hard Bruins fan, as many of you know, so I&#039;m not too displeased lol...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello from Philadelphia! I am not pressing the panic button... yet. I&#039;ve heard rumblings from fans who blame shoddy goaltending and speculate a shake-up trade or change in coaching is imminent if things don&#039;t turn around soon. I think it&#039;s too soon for such complaints and speculation. I think Bryzgalov has looked fairly steady. I also think it&#039;s too soon to make a drastic change. Laviolette is a very well liked and proven coach. There hasn&#039;t been any one player that has stood out as being the &quot;problem&quot; or playing particularly poorer than his teammates. The Flyers as a whole just look rusty. At whatever point your captain takes two stupid penalties in one game, there&#039;s a team-wide problem.]]></description>
