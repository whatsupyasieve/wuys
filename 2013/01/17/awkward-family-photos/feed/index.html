		<description><![CDATA[Haha, the Sens guy you circled is Jared Cowen, a young defenseman who&#039;s probably not smiling because he&#039;s missing the entire 2013 season with a hip injury sustained while playing in the AHL. But the rest of my boys are pretty chipper, hmm? :) &#060;3]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I scared my dog because I was laughing out loud. What is up with Carlson and Backstrom??? These pictures are so amazingly bad that I have to believe it was all an inside joke to get the worst pictures in the league. Thanks for making me laugh and I look forward to many new posts.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is definitely hestined for the WUYS HOF.  Laughed my butt off!!!

You have to wonder if the lockout seriously messed with some of these guys, though.  Many of them look MARKEDLY different from usual - and I&#039;m not just talking about puberty (in the case of Intern Jeff).  Some of them look like they&#039;ve been waking and baking for months, in addition to not shaving (as opposed to growing a lockout beard - just not shaving).  And then there are guys who have sorta become polished young men over the past few months.  It&#039;s creepy, curious and interesting.  Hopefully somebody will write a book chronicling what all these gentlemen did during this infamous period in hockey history.

Oh, and Chuck - I agree 1000% re Piglet looking like Mrs. Swedish Chef.  And I&#039;m super glad everybody&#039;s taking notice of Mr. Burns.  He&#039;s a trip-and-a-half in more ways than one!  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Holy Grizzly Adams Brent Burns!!! He is such a gorgeous man. Quit it right now. I&#039;ll admit Geno and Sid do look like they just rolled out of bed, but we all KNOW they look better than these unfortunate pictures, but Nealer looks great.  He may have actually washed his hair, too. Those first three Blackhawks do look like they came in from partying ALL night, especially Kane. hehe I&#039;m just so happy that hockey is back, though, that I don&#039;t care what any of them look like:D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This post is perfection. It explains everything I&#039;ve wanted to say about these roster photos since they started popping up on tumblr a couple days ago. Duncan, Seabrook, and Kane look like they just got off a week long bender. Geno looks like he literally just got off the 14 hour plane ride from Russia. Thank god for Stamkos and Toews. Always the overachieving heroes. Bless them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1. hilarious post.
2. I am crying. What has happened to the Caps? Gotten too cool for school? I blame MG52&#039;s &quot;girlfriend&quot;...she probably encourages this type of look. Thank god for Brooks keepin&#039; it real.
3.Here&#039;s a thought, maybe we (females) are to blame...we all seem to love beards/LL Bean boyfriends/etc, maybe of the guys are slightly insecure and wanting to fit in with our vision of perfection. 

eh, I&#039;m gonna continue to blame MG52&#039;s gf. Makes things easier.]]></description>
