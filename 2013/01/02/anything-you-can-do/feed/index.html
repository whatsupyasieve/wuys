		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been irrationally angry about being American for the last week. I can&#039;t sign up for these wake up calls and half the videos on TSN don&#039;t work for me. If I&#039;m waking up before the crack of dawn to watch hockey, the least America could do is give me a hockey player whispering in my ear.

		<description><![CDATA[Can I just point out that I fangirled the Oilers before it was cool? *pushes up non-prescription dark rim glasses that my friend won&#039;t let me buy* #intrepidpervert

And as much as I was hoping for the JT19 morning glory (ahem), that call won&#039;t happen. Not because the world would cease to be at the sound of Jon&#039;s sexy husky morning voice, but this very effective gimmick is a Nike thing. Your move, Bauer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Toews one has to be for the semifinals. Canada vs. USA, IT&#039;S PERFECT! He can remind us of his 3-for-3 shootout performance in 2007.
