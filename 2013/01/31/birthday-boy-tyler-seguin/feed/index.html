		<description><![CDATA[In defense of everyone posting here, he looks WAY older (and even cuter) than he did when he came to Boston a few seasons ago. I&#039;m only 5 years older than Seguin, but for what it&#039;s worth it could be 20 years, I still feel like he&#039;s such a baby! Looking at all of these pictures made me feel kinda dirty cuz I never found him attractive...I saved my undying affection and absurd fantasies for the McQuaids, Krejcis, Girouxs, Gaboriks, and Nashs of the NHL. I&#039;m just going to have to pretend I never saw this...because I&#039;m afraid I just saw little Segs in a whole new light. I think he needs to lose a front tooth so all you ladies can cool down a little bit. ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After the UA commercial, I can safely and freely admit he is the only Bruin I would let do all things of unimaginably dirty and inappropriate things to me. I have no shame. I&#039;m only a month older than him, so yay? 

May the city of Boston live in fear of this kid&#039;s antics. He&#039;s the next PKane, calling it.

Happy birthday, TS.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is it wrong that I find him LESS appealing at 21? Yes, it super is. Let me explain. I think it&#039;s because his charming idiot-teenage-boy-antics will now seem played out. Oh, who am I kidding. I cannot resist. He remains #3. In the eloquent words of my friend Diana: &quot;I want to slap him in the face but then make out with his face.&quot;

Also - why is his sister on the floor of a restaurant? I have... misgivings about her.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really wish that I could slow down that gif where he throws the ball at the wall, Tyler Seguin is magnificent and impossible to resist. Your constant posting about him finally convinced some time ago, or maybe it was the UA commercial, but I used to be exclusive to my beloved Blackhawks. I can&#039;t say that anymore, you have corrupted me, and I am beyond even trying to fight it. Happy 21st to TS19, may the city of Boston forever live in fear of your antics :P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ok, I&#039;ll come clean.  I may, sorta, like this guy.  A little.

I&#039;d feel a lot less dirty about it if we could add a number ranging from 7-10 to his age.

Happy Birthday, Segs...may the Lord have mercy on your liver!]]></description>
