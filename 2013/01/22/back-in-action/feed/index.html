		<description><![CDATA[such a great weekend.  i was so happy just sitting on my couch soaking it all in.

i went to the devils&#039; home opener last night and i was literally and figuratively in my happy place.  a 3-0 victory over the flyers was an awesome &quot;welcome back&quot; to the rock. (marty&#039;s 120th career shut out. 120!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yep, that&#039;s pretty much all I did this weekend. Every team I wanted to win, did! Perfect way to start this season! Especially the Blackhawks! Being the only person in my house that watches hockey I got that &quot;You&#039;re crazy&quot; look A LOT! =D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hopefully I can get some great shots of the guys! If I do, I&#039;ll pass them along to you to help ease your pain. 

Though I can&#039;t guarantee I&#039;ll get focused photos of Stahlberg and Sharpie since I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll be able to steady my camera.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t agree more! This past weekend was fantastic! Roadtripped to Columbus, OH last night to watch the Blue Jackets v Red Wings and experienced the amazing SO goal by Brunner ... not to mention I think I got some nice shots of Zetterberg! 

And I&#039;ll be headed back to Columbus this weekend to see (my team!) the Blackhawks play! Can&#039;t wait to see Taser, Kaner, Sharpie, Stahlberg and everyone in between play in person!

Thank God hockey is back!]]></description>
