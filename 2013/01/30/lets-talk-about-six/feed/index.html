		<description><![CDATA[I believe it&#039;s sometime between 8 and 9 am on Wednesday&#039;s, unless they are on the road. If you love Sharp and the Hawks you&#039;ll love the show. He talks about everyone. You can listen here during Eric and Kathy&#039;s show http://www.wtmx.com. They also have a podcast of Sharp Attack. http://www.wtmx.com/podcast/20130129-Sharp_Attack_with_Blackhawk_Patrick_Sharp.mp3]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not only is Patrick Sharp beautiful, but he knows his NKOTB trivia. Wednesday&#039;s are usually when Sharp Attack is on (101.9 The Mix). Sharpie is hilarious. There&#039;s a bit of a who&#039;s better looking rivalry between Stahlberg and Sharpie. Lots of good Blackhawks info from the show and super funny comments i.e. &quot;Only Stahlberg could play in Siberia and come back with a tan.&quot; Love me some Patrick Sharp.

Go Hawks!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well - if I wasn&#039;t already enough of a jinx! They can lose tonight. I can handle it. As long as they come ready to fight on Friday in Vancouver.

And hey!! Since the November game was cancelled, this is **MY** 30th birthday game too!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[See Pants?? That SMILE. It&#039;s why PKane makes my list and Nealer does not. But moving on....I do not understand this PARALLEL universe in which the Hawks are 6-0, and every game prepare myself for the inevitability in which the lose. Negative, yes. Practical, yes. So I&#039;m totally ready for tonight&#039;s game against Minnesota. 

Fingers crossed they beat the 28th team in the League, the Flames, when I see them play this weekend - I have birthday tickets and plan on getting 30th birthday druuuuuuuuunk.]]></description>
