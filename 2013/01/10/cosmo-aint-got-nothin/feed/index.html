		<description><![CDATA[I hate these lists that force you to choose only one player with model looks for each team. Toews, Letang, Neal, Hank, etc. etc. don&#039;t just deserve spots on this list, they deserves spots towards the TOP of it!!! Damn them for being on teams with such aesthetically pleasing rosters!!! Damn them to hell! Shoot, Hank is one of the most beautiful people period! Whenever I think of Henrik Lundqvist I think of him on the cover of a romance novel titled &quot;Between the Pipes&quot;. He&#039;s shirtless and gently caressing the Stanley Cup with his million dollar smile that was carved in the heavens by Michael Angelo himself. Like, Cosmo needs to realize that if they leave off the Coyotes and Columbus so that they can include Jonathan Toews and Kris Letang, nobody will even notice. And even if they do notice, who is really gonna complain? Or create some sort of &quot;honorable mentions&quot; category. Who cares about the Oscar-snubs. Henrik being left off this list is the biggest travesty of the year thus far.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Love your revised list. Even players were confused that Henrik was excluded.

As a Stars fan, I don&#039;t think Jagr is unattractive but wholeheartedly agree with your revision to Loui and mention of Morrow.

No biggie because it happens all the time, but his name is spelled Brenden Morrow. :)]]></description>

I&#039;ll have to show Lundqvist&#039;s picture to my mom. She&#039;s not a hockey fan but she was married to a Swede for over 50 years...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It goes without saying that Cosmo was smoking some serious crack when they put Kessel on the list for the Leafs instead of John Michael Liles.  Sorry Lupul, Liles stole my heart in Denver and it followed him to Toronto.  As it will if he goes to another team.  Seriously, he&#039;s so handsome it should be illegal!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mmmmmmm Erik Karlsson. If it couldn&#039;t have been Tanger to get the Norris last year, then I was ok with the yummy and talented Karlsson. Ok, sorry Pants, but for the Caps, I would have gone with Holtby or Perreault (he has that whole Xavier Leflamme thing going on for me. lol) Definitely Jordan for the &#039;Canes, but soooo painful at the same time:(  There would HAVE to be a three, four or five way tie for the Pens, tho. Sid, Nealer, Tanger, Nisky (love our American boy) AND Geno IMHO:))]]></description>

As for the Blackhawks, Stahlberg would have been my choice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t get me wrong, I think Sharp and Toews are both hot, and it&#039;s hard to deny that the Blackhawks have a lot of hot men, and Stahlberg gives Sharp a run for the title, but I mean, how could anyone overlook Bollig? http://babesdigballs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/FINAL23.jpg

Ultimately, Bollig would be my pick for the hottest list, hands down. 

I&#039;m with you all on most of the rest of them. Cosmo&#039;s reply hilariously made some comment about not judging them as bad hockey fans because they&#039;re a women&#039;s interest magazine; no, Cosmo, it&#039;s because you picked the worst images and had terribly lame captions to go with them!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am with you, ladies!  That Cosmo list was horrible!!

I agree with most of your alternatives, but I have to disagree with Seguin as your Boston pick.  Nobody on that team surpasses the all around hotness/skill/nice guy vibe of The Professor.

Also, Jamie Benn, Gingeroux, and Penner.  Drool!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank God this list came out! And no better time than while I&#039;m freezing my dirty dangles off outside of Flyers preseason practice. SIDE NOTE: Giroux just drove by with 20 lbs of rock salt sprayed across his car. Gave me a nod on his way past approving of YOUR nod (or so we should assume). I know how hard it is to pick just one from each team but seriously, Cosmo,  do some legwork! Great job, ladies!]]></description>

He&#039;s a giant, funny, Irish, hockey-playing kid from Boston with great hair who believes in family values and retweets things about manners. Are you kidding me?

Sorry, Hank - Brian Boyle will always get my vote.]]></description>
