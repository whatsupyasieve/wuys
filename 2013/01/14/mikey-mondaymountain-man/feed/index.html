		<description><![CDATA[Speaking of roster photos... the Blackhawks have taken theirs. I haven&#039;t browsed all of them (as you say, there is no time!), but quick summation:

1) Jonathan Toews looks as if he said to himself &quot;How can I look hotter than anyone has ever looked in the history of hotness?&quot; and BAM.

2) Patrick Kane looks as if he said to himself &quot;Duuurrrrrr.&quot; Let&#039;s hope he gets a do-over. I know he has the stitches, but he could have at least gotten a hair cut. There was no one in the room with under-eye concealer handy? It&#039;s a damn shame.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[God, that photo with his Patrick Sharp hair? How could you (Mike) not look at that everyday as your inspiration? How could you think that this overly-tatted, beard/mountain man is better?? I miss 24/7 Mike.

Also isn&#039;t it kind of funny that he waited until the lockout was over to get lasic done? I mean...you had 8 months...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[LOL I understand! Neck tattoos are like this weird &quot;in theory&quot; thing for me. I would never actually date someone that has one, but I don&#039;t mind looking at it from afar!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the new look, Mike looks like he ALWAYS needs a good shower. Just don&#039;t like it. Then there is the beard. I like a nice, maintained beard not one that looks like there may be some nits in it. Mike seems to always be into what he likes whether it be cars, his condo, his clothes, etc. Now it seems like he is trying hard to show that he really doesn&#039;t care what he looks like, but he really does car.]]></description>
