		<description><![CDATA[(Meant to put this here...)

Luckily most of my other hockey loves are in the Western Conference so it doesn’t come up too much, but Brian Boyle and Adam McQuaid punching each other’s faces was a little too much for me to process. I have tickets for the next B’s/Rangers game on the 12th so I am praying I don’t have to witness this in person. Lord knows, I’ll be getting escorted out of TD in no time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ve ever seen a team drop it like its hot so many times. Every time the Bruins went to take the shot from the net, the Rangers players would drop and manage to get a body part on the puck.  #RangersDown]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#039;Errybody Dougie!  You&#039;d never think that he is only 19 the way that he presents himself out there.  I can only imagine that being around guys like Chara, Ference, Seidenberg in the locker room, showing you the ropes has got to help.

I just don&#039;t know.  Cover my eyes and wait until it is all over?  It was hard yesterday because I love Rick Nash and every time he took a shot I was hoping he would score but not score.  I was a woman conflicted.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tough times at MSG for the B&#039;s last night but I loved their resilience. Dougie has impressed me so much. I loved his style of play at World Juniors and I was hoping he could bring that to the table eventually. I never thought it would be three games in! The way he works the point is unreal. 

But last night posed a new question for me - What do you do when your two favorite players fight each other?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My favorite thing about that last gif (the awesome Dougie shot and ensuing goal aside) is the perfect demonstration of point #3: two of the three Rangers players in between the puck and the net drop down SO FAST to block that shot. Which they fail to do, but still. Downnn they go!]]></description>
