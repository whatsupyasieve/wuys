		<description><![CDATA[AMAZING choice! Damn Malone is FINE. That&#039;s right...FINE. I&#039;m all about the tats, and his GGB (which aught to become a thing around here, BTW) - the man is a gem. Well chosen ladies.

And let&#039;s raise a glass to another influx of Foxy Fridays with the season returning tomorrow! Happy Christmas Eve everyone!]]></description>
