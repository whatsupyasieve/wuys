		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a Kings fan and I have absolutely no problem with this celebration. It was an unbelievable goal and a back-breaker for the Kings. Compound that on top of the previous goal being disallowed, they pulled it together and deserved an epic celebration. God forbid hockey should make the &quot;Top 10&quot; on Sportscenter...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I do not like the Oilers. But I admire their spirit. Their fans are in denial (this is not the year) but again...their spirit. I admire it. And God DAMN I love hockey.

The kid never been there before and he tied with with 4 seconds left.  We&#039;re lucky he didn&#039;t strip down to his pads and wave his shirt around his head like Dean the Bash Brother in Mighty Ducks 2.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is why we watch hockey. Because we hope, against hope, that our team can come back and tie it up with less than a minute to go. Because we want to see two teams battle it out. We want to see players inspire us with their tenacity and skill. We want to stand up and cheer and yell and jump around. We want to see grown men celebrate with the joy of little boys (ok the grown men bit might not quite apply here- he&#039;s only 19!). Would it be excessive if it were a Crosby, Giroux, or Kane? Unless it was the Stanley Cup playoffs, probably. But not last night. Last night it was everything hockey is supposed to be!]]></description>
