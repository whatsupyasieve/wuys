		<description><![CDATA[The Rangers did a blue carpet entrance for their home opener with current and former players (although some players didn&#039;t participate - Henrik&#039;s routine cannot be altered).  I tried to take a picture of Brian Boyle, but he was so handsome that I got too flustered.  I did get to high-5 Brad Richards.  He has very soft hands.  He definitely moisturizes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was at the red carpet event and let me tell you the pictures don&#039;t do it justice because these men are so gorgeous.  I kind of wanted to faint when Tazer walked past and I got my high five.  And Sharpy my god!

But my favorite was Bollig and his scarf - damn he made it work.  

(My tumblr has some of my crappy cellphone pics if anyone wants to see - the one of Bollig is probably the only pic that somewhat came out.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[MY BABIES!!!!! I am SO HAPPY. The Blackhawks are coming to Vancouver next Friday and I am seriously considering going by myself because no one else is willing to pay the exorbitant ticket prices (cheapest nosebleeds are well over $100 after taxes and fees). It will be the most grown up thing I will have ever done. And I do not miss the irony in that.

I read the other day that &quot;you can&#039;t teach Jonathan Toews&#039; intangibles&quot;. And that is what is happening with this taupey-grey-navy-tweed combination. Like, it just works. Or TWERKS as it were. On paper PSharp&#039;s All-American-by-way-of-Thunder-Bay look or Stalberg&#039;s Euro Swag (seriously, that suit was tailored by enchanted Swedish angels) are better, but they are just not. Jon is most. Always. 

PS - Patrick Kane, my perfect little cherub, please reconsider this current hair. Unless it is the source of all your badassery on the ice, in which case please skeeze on.]]></description>
