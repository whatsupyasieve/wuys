		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t know he made wine!  Cool!  However, &quot;the Great One was immediately inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, the only player to ever have this honor&quot;

Not true.  He was the last one to have this happen, but he&#039;s far from the only one -- there have been nine others before him:
-Dit Clapper
-Maurice Richard
-Ted Lindsay
-Red Kelly
-Terry Sawchuk
-Jean Beliveau
-Gordie Howe
-Bobby Orr
-Mario Lemieux

The Hall announced that after Gretzky, though, they would no longer do this, except for &quot;humanitarian reasons&quot; (I guess if someone dies or is seriously injured?)

He is, however, the only one to have his jersey # retired league wide.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I keep trying to tell my friends who are trying to get their Canadian citizenship that knowing the year Gretzky got traded to the Kings is on the exam, but they don&#039;t believe me. Related: that should really be on the exam. And just like every other natural born citizen, I would probably flunk the shit out of that exam. Because I can&#039;t remember. &#039;91??]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Once I was sitting outside Casa Vega in Studio City, LA with some friends.  Wayne and Janet came out... and no one told me.  Everyone else saw them except me.  My friend Lisa came running over, &quot;Did you see Wayne Gretzky?&quot; and I said, &quot;WHAT?!?!?!?!&quot;

She said, &quot;Oh, sorry.  Well, even if you didn&#039;t see him, he saw you.&quot;

Not the same, folks.]]></description>
