		<description><![CDATA[I know how you feel.  So many people are saying they are boycotting.  What the league needs to understand is that without us, THE FANS, they will have no to come to their games, no one to buy tickets, eat their good, to them play.  The fans are the bottom of the pyramid but without a sturdy bottom, you can&#039;t build to the top.

The NHL should apologize to the fans because they hurt themselves real bad.  Especially after having record breaking years was it?  But to me, I miss the game.  I want to go to the games.  This season I finally bought season tickets and damn straight am I going!

As I said on Sunday, hockey is like a drug.  When it&#039;s gone, like the lockout, we don&#039;t care, we say we don&#039;t need it.  But when it&#039;s back in our possession, we can&#039;t help ourselves.  We want it.  We crave it.  We need it.
