		<description><![CDATA[&quot;As much as Neal &#038; Letang next to each other could probably reverse the Earth’s magnetic poles, Nealer’s about the wrist shot.  It’s dazzling.  It’s accurate.  Seeing him just behind the faceoff circle, waiting for the drop pass… it makes me weak in the twine.&quot;

That paragraph speaks to me. While I was sad about the lockout lasting as long as it did, it led to me finding your blog while I was digging for any sort of hockey life back in November and I&#039;ve loved it ever since. Best thing to come out of the lockout for me! Here&#039;s to hoping Nealer and his new tattooed arms find a way to get the puck in the net on the PP no matter where he is!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[LOL! That&#039;s the first thing that caught my eye. Didn&#039;t need to see the jockstrap but when you&#039;ve got the lovely James Neal in the shot who cares about a nasty, funky jockstrap.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Even Nealer&#039;s glorious, sweaty flow couldn&#039;t keep me from noticing the nasty jockstrap behind him to the left. 

However, that smile at 1:28 could make me blush, then melt into a puddle on the spot!]]></description>
