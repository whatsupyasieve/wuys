		<description><![CDATA[As a Flyers fan, I am very happy with the choice though Briere or Kimmo would have been good choices as well.  I was surprised about the announcement since I had heard it would be on Thursday at the open practice which I believe will be televised around here. I will be watching it for sure. Honestly, aside from his dashing good looks, G is really well respected and loved by the fans. He is very humble in the interviews I have seen and really puts the team ahead of his accomplishments. That epic shift which, I know was a killer for Pens fans, really showed that he had earned the right to wear the C.  As someone from the Flyers organization said, it is his team. It really is true.  I do feel badly for Pronger. This isn&#039;t the way any player wants to end his career.  I know the Flyers are giving him time to deal with all of it.  Say what you want about the organization but they treat their players(in most cases) like family and I am sure they will honor him in some way when the time is right. But for now, it is G&#039;s team, and I expect good things ahead! And on a last note, I saw the interview with that reporter and laughed so hard with the look she gave G. I figured you ladies would spot it too. I wouldn&#039;t have been able to ask a question because I would have already swooned and fallen to floor.  His looks, his voice....just can&#039;t take it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s been a lot of discussion about Pronger in Philly, at least among the fans I know. There was discussion of making the captain announcement at Thursday night&#039;s open practice in front of the fans, some sort of official ceremony with Pronger. Pronger is back in the city and working with the team, I believe helping coach the defense. From what I&#039;ve heard Pronger is having a very difficult time with the sudden end to his career. It seems the team is letting Pronger take the lead in terms of how much press and attention he is comfortable with, and may be why they scrapped their initial announcement plans. Right now Pronger has stated he does not want to do any interviews.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amanda asked if Taylor prefers a May or June wedding. I&#039;m thinking July, when he can guarantee it won&#039;t interfere with a Cup run (not that the Oilers have a chance of that - I&#039;M SORRY BUT I HAD TO)

Re Giroux: K at first I was all like &quot;Non, non, non&quot; with the photos of his short hair but the one of him looking at the camera....? Damn. Oh Captain, my Captain. I&#039;d agree with either G or Briere as Captain - G is the sexier choice (don&#039;t deny it Pants). 

My only beef is that nobody is acknowledging Chris Pronger. I&#039;m not even a Flyers OR Pronger fan but I think someone who has their career ended because of muppets in their head and persistent concussion symptoms deserved to be recognized. It makes me sad.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m happy to provide the Philly fan perspective. Here Claude is known to be a very vocal leader both on the ice and in the locker room. A great example of G&#039;s leadership is the infamous playoff game against the Penguins last season. He told his teammates &quot;watch me on the first shift&quot; and went out putting a hard hit on Crosby and scored a goal. Then turned back to his teammates and said something along the lines of &quot;see, I told you so, now let&#039;s go.&quot; This elicited high praise from Coach Peter Laviolette and line mate Jaromir Jagr who called him the best player in the world.
