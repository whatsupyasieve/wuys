		<description><![CDATA[Awesome pictures!  I love these types of photos.  Several years ago, when my Sabres were actually legitimate, there was a photographer from the DC area who had ties to Buffalo that took similar photos.  Loved them!  Here&#039;s the link:http://www.mikelynaugh.com/
A good many of the players in the photos no longer play for the sabres, but it&#039;s fun to go back and dream of a better time....  : )]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of course, I totally love the one of Neal, although they&#039;re all pretty awesome! I&#039;m always going on about how long his lower lashes are, but they&#039;re fine and you can&#039;t always see them clearly...well, THERE THEY ARE!! :) Just gorgeous. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[See? These are the kind of photographs I would LOVE to take! I don&#039;t want to do weddings or babies or family protraits. 

THIS. 

THIS is what I&#039;d love to do.

Sigh. As Rhonda (I think) pointed out in the Gabe/McD&#039;s blog, where was this booth on career day??]]></description>
