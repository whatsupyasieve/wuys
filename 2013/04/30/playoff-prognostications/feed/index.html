		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with Chuck on everything except the Sharks - I think the Canucks get out of Round 1, but not Round 2; the Senators (or I assume the Senators?) &#038; the Bruins - I don&#039;t think they get out of their recent funk quickly enough.  

I&#039;d like to see the Isles take a game (or 2) off the Pens.  I think it&#039;ll generally be a bloodbath, but the Isles have worked really hard not to suck these past couple of years and I&#039;d like to see them get rewarded for that.]]></description>

&quot;There is nothing he (and I) would like better than to take his injuries, time missed and all the shit-talk and shove it down every other team’s throat until they choke.&quot;
