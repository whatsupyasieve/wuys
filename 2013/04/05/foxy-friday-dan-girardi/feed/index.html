		<description><![CDATA[WRAP THAT THING IN BUBBLE WRAP. I echo the statements - that is criminal. How does his wife let him go to work like that?? Shame. 

Ugh, these videos make me like the Rangers. BE STRONG FOR THE PENS. It&#039;s a good thing HBO hasn&#039;t released the 2012 24/7 on DVD or WHO KNOWS what would happen. There&#039;s just a litany of beauty on the Blueshirts to choose from.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well done Brenda! Been waiting for a long time to see &quot;G&quot; make Foxy Friday. I don&#039;t want kids either and when I see G with Landon my ovaries explode and I turn into a puddle of female hormones on the floor. G really is the man of steel on the Rangers, after all, he is BFF&#039;s with Callahan, aka Captain America.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[*TWO SNAPS UP FOR BRENDA*

Well done and totally a deserving Foxy Friday. He was on my short list for entries I was too busy to write this week. You did him more justice than I could have, I&#039;m sure. And full face cages? HE DOESN&#039;T EVEN WEAR A VISOR. It is criminal not to protect all that handsome. And P&#038;C, we share a brain, clearly, as the only thing I was thinking while looking at the pictures was that he is SUPER Cavillian. *le grand swoon*]]></description>
