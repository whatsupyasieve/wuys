		<description><![CDATA[Love, love, LOVE the Eddie Redmayne reference!!! :) What the hell is in the water in Sweden?!?  They grow them so pretty over there. lol As long as they keep letting them come over here to provide us with eye candy (and a little hockey ability), I actually don&#039;t care. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As far as scratches go, could just depend on the game and the situation - could be Thornton one came, Kelly another, Paille for another, etc.  The important thing for the Bruins is that their lines work and increase offense.  They win but they aren&#039;t a team that puts up alot of goals.  Don&#039;t think that Soderberg will get in there right away and just turn it on.  He&#039;s never played at this level and let&#039;s face it, it ain&#039;t exactly easy. I think more of it is to get him in, get him skating with the guys and move him along with the intention to get him prepared for 2013-2014 season.

No timeline yet for Bergeron, but I miss him terribly.  And so does the Bruins&#039; face-off winning percentage.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll be curious to see what he adds. It&#039;s funny though. As a Hawks fan, I haven&#039;t minded when Coach Q shakes things up with the lines. But the Bruins ... maybe it&#039;s the Seguinista in me but when I heard Segs was put on the 3rd line this last game, I was like, WHAT?!?!? So the Bruins bring in this guy and I hope can bring in some much needed scoring, but then who will the Bruins scratch? I&#039;m concerned about more line shake ups, to say the least.

When&#039;s the Professor going to be back from that concussion??]]></description>
