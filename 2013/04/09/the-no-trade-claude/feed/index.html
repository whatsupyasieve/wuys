		<description><![CDATA[The reason I mentioned the AHL threat was because I think that&#039;s how the Flyers got Gagne version 1.0 to waive his NTC, although maybe that was another player. Cutting playing time would make more sense to pressure him, but he&#039;s been injured a fair bit this season and could probably use the rest even once he comes back, since it sounds like he might be pushing it sooner than he should. He did say earlier that he hadn&#039;t been asked to waive it, but then he got hurt and couldn&#039;t be moved this season. I guess it really comes down to if/when they&#039;re considering doing something about his cap hit and what sort of relationship the team has with him/how &quot;nice&quot; everyone wants to be to each other.

Briere probably doesn&#039;t even need to take (much) less money, just have a smaller cap hit, for some teams, because his play doesn&#039;t drop off during the play-offs and he has veteran leadership experience and all those other intangibles teams like to talk about. (And he puts up with the media so the Philly reporters haven&#039;t skewered him yet.) 

The Capitals are indeed an easy distance from the Flyers! And before games against the Flyers, he could still ride the train down with them...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Jess! We have quite the team of crack researchers here when I can&#039;t find what I&#039;m looking for.  

Danny&#039;s contract is a NMC, not a NTC.  They&#039;d never AHL him anyway, so it&#039;s really the same thing.  Most speculation I&#039;ve seen talks about the Flyers cutting his playing time to push him out.  That would just make me more mad, but perhaps Danny is more reasonable than I.

He doesn&#039;t get a say in the Amnesty Buyout, but he can give the Flyers no other option by sitting on the NMC.  And you&#039;re right - that would allow him to pick his team (from whoever&#039;s interested) rather than letting the Flyers pick it for him.  As an UFA, Danny would need a brand new contract - he could take less money to attract even more teams into the bidding.  Like the Capitals.  We&#039;re close enough, right?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[According to Capgeek, Briere has a No Movement Clause, not a No Trade Clause, in his contract. An NMC means a team can&#039;t pressure a player to waive the clause by threatening to send him down to the AHL. Such a player can still be a healthy scratch, of course, or amnestied/bought out. But it means a team has less bargaining power over a player it asks to waive the clause - especially when an amnesty would give the player 2/3 of his remaining salary and let him sign with whatever team he wants (assuming it wants him), instead of taking a chance that that team has offered his current team enough to make it his current team&#039;s choice. Or he could just retire after that if he didn&#039;t want to move away from an area, whereas a trade might send him across the continent.

But, everything I&#039;ve seen is that injured players can&#039;t be amnestied/bought out, which means at this moment Briere can&#039;t be on the list (although he&#039;s apparently trying to return this week), nor can Pronger. (Nor, for that matter, can a huge chunk of the Flyers.) Pronger&#039;s contract is a 35+, so it wouldn&#039;t make sense to use an amnesty on him even if he were healthy. (Also, it wouldn&#039;t make sense to use an amnesty on him if he were healthy because if he were, he&#039;d be playing. Philadelphia&#039;s current D is basically 38-year-old Kimmo Timonen, who is a great guy but also reportedly in walking casts while not playing because of plantar fasciitis; Luke Schenn; and third-pairing guys and/or call-ups from one of the worst AHL teams this year.)

Note: I haven&#039;t read up everything about the new CBA  yet, but I don&#039;t remember seeing anything about retroactive changes to 35+ contracts or NMCs. If someone else has, I&#039;d be happy to be pointed to it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This makes MUCH more sense than the way I was reading it.  Now I see why a buyout would benefit the Flyers.  They&#039;d get more back in cap space than the spend to buy him out.

The NHL salary cap rules are like shopping a Kohl&#039;s.  There&#039;s always some discount - you never know what it is until you get to the register but it&#039;s always less than the retail price.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Greetings! Not to get too contract-nerdy, but Danny&#039;s deal was front loaded. So he&#039;s only due $3 million next year and $2 million the year after. If he&#039;s bought out, I assume it is 2/3 of the remaining $5 million. (I think the capgeek calc is for how the $6.5 million cap hit would apply in a non-amnesty buyout.)

So either he&#039;s back for two years $5 million, traded and plays for another team for two years $5 million, or is bought out for 2/3 and then can sign a new deal with a new team.

I assume he&#039;ll be bought out because that is a huge cap relief for not a big $ amount, although it makes me sad because I love him.

BTW, love the blog!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hahaha thanks ladies. The orange and black shout out is much appreciated. We have def had a tumultuous year and as the entirety of the NHL knows, our front desk is a loose canon so no body knows where Danny B will be come training camp &#039;13-&#039;14. I my heart of hearts I hope he will stay. He has 3 preteen, er,  2 teen and one preteen reason to not waive  the NTC and frankly, he&#039;s the only guy on the team who isn&#039;t a blithering, idiotic machine of over used phrases in an interview (not pointing my finger at any particular dashing ginger captain or anything...) but, if management is trying to resurrect the Broad Street Bullies persona that brought this city its only two cups, there&#039;s no room for a soft spoken, thoughtful Frenchie which is a shame because his style was just coming around. Plus, I don&#039;t know where all the wayward rising superstars are going to live if he leaves cause nobody billets like a  Briere.]]></description>
