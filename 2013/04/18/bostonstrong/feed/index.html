		<description><![CDATA[Sorry it&#039;s taken me so long to respond to this: I think you know just how worried I was about you,Chuck, and all my friends from Boston. Despite being a Brit, living in the UK, I have a number of friends in the Boston area (some I consider family) and the city just grabbed me firmly and held on. 

I&#039;ll be back in the Fall for Thanksgiving. It&#039;s a wicked pissah town. My kind of town.

Love and hugs to all of you affected personally by this x]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was so relieved to hear you we&#039;re kept safe through this unbelievable act of violence. Thoughts and prayers are with all Bostonians as you all try to heal physically, mentally, as emotionally. I was moved to tears by last night&#039;s national anthem at TD Garden. I got such goosebumps when &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; was played at Consol and my Pens were singing along. Hockey is so much more than just a sport and the players are so much more than just athletes. So thankful that Boston has such a wonderful team to be somewhat of a distraction and definitely a bright spot in this scary time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We are ALL Boston right now, just as we were all NYC after 9/11...and proud to be so! We&#039;re also HUMAN, and the greatest blessing is that the large majority of us have an intrinsic spirit that is loving, caring, and giving. This is embodied most by the Police, Fire, EMS, Service Members, and citizens who ran in when everyone else was running out. I&#039;ve been brought to tears numerous times by the love, generosity of spirit, and plain old togetherness that has sprung up this week.

SO glad you&#039;re safe, Chuck. Stay Boston Strong &#038; know that you are ALL loved!!! &#060;3]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Beautifully said.

One of the things I&#039;ve always loved about hockey since I was a kid was that it was like being part of a giant family. Maybe it was dysfunctional at times, but you always knew someone had your back no matter what. Now, when Boston needed it the most, the hockey family stood up for all of us and while I wasn&#039;t surprised, I was definitely overwhelmed. 

I am so glad you are safe. Sending my love from the other end of the state &#060;3]]></description>
