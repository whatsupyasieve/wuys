		<description><![CDATA[Oh my gosh! :) Glad I could share the foxiness with everyone!! (and side note- I&#039;ve tried to watch that 22:45 video 4 times, and always can&#039;t make it past 10 minutes...today will be the day!).

Thank you to Pants and Chuck for the challenge, and to you all for reading.

		<description><![CDATA[Lovely! I knew today was going to be a good day. He&#039;s especially foxy this season now that he and his team improved and will make a playoff run (last couple of crappy games not withstanding). I&#039;ve had a crush on him forever. I deeply appreciate the fight with Tim Thomas since not that many goalies are willing to take a few punches and join their teams in melees. I am also willing to forgive the frosted tips and the ridiculously pretty fiancee (ever seen the engagement pics?) if he promises to never take the cowboy hat off during the off season. Awesome choice!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am a Leafs fan with a guilty love for Carey Price. I have been waiting for this day to come and it&#039;s great. He&#039;s half cowboy half Indian (Aboriginal) and all sexy. I think he grew up on a tiny reserve in BC so he&#039;s not a Frenchie. Also related to Shane Doan and Keaton Ellerby. Just thought I&#039;d throw it all out there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just so you know, Carey, er... um... didn&#039;t do a whole hell of a lot during the 09-10 playoffs.  It was Jaroslav Halak who took over as the habs #1 goaltender for a few months... BUT he looked REAL good sittin&#039; on the bench!]]></description>

Overall, well done Cheryl. You also get my *two snaps up*. At the risk of sounding boastful, WUYS has the best. Fans. Ever.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not annoying! I just can&#039;t read.  It was &#039;09-&#039;10 I was referring too, and I fixed it.  Though &#039;09 would be worth mentioning because the Habs lost to the Bruins in the first round and that makes Chuck all kinds of happy.

Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry if i&#039;m being annoying, but in the 20009 Eastern Conference finals, the Penguins defeated the Hurricanes....just so you know. :P
But all in all, Carey Price is indeed foxy and very sexy!]]></description>
