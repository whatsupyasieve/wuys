		<description><![CDATA[I read somewhere that the goal of this year&#039;s campaign is to appeal to a broader audience this time around, as in not just the hardcore fans. Because of the lockout the NHL lost a lot of &quot;fair-weather&quot; fans. They&#039;re trying to gain them back, and more, by making these commercials more of an introduction than an emotional punch to the face.  I did enjoy the one about how quirky the players are. I can&#039;t help it that Jason Spezza&#039;s laugh gets me every time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was &quot;Meh&quot; on them too. And YOU KNOW WHAT TOEWS AND KANE DO TO MY FEELS.

Maybe they should actually intersplice clips of Love Actually into this campaign. Too bad Sam is busy being Jojen Reid.]]></description>
