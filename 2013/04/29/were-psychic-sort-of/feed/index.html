Well I (very biasedly, if that&#039;s even a word) had the Rangers much, much higher, amongst many other misses.  I did make predictions on Jan 19, but they were so, so very off.

The only team I have positionally correct is the Canucks in the West - none in the East.  I got 5/8 qualifiers right in the East, but was way off on my pick for DFL.  In the West, I got 6/8 qualifiers right, but was also wrong on my pick for DFL.

I will, therefore, not quit my day job, but I still submit that I&#039;d be a better GM than Darcy Regier.]]></description>
