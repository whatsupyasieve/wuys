		<description><![CDATA[Not afraid, per se.  Well, I&#039;m afraid of everything after what happened last season in Caps vs. Rangers.  I&#039;m more enraged or frenzied or possibly even unhinged at the existence of the Rangers all, let alone when playing one of my teams in the playoffs.  I&#039;ve felt this way about the Rangers since 1991.  It doesn&#039;t go away.]]></description>
