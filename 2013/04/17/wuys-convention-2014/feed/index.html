		<description><![CDATA[March 1, 2014 is my eighteenth birthday, and you are all officially invited to my party at Soldier Field. You can meet all my boyfriends. They&#039;ll be the gorgeous ones on skates. 

But seriously, I know what I&#039;m asking for for my birthday already. Saving up now to watch the two best teams in the league! This is all too much! GAHHH!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can we be sure Tazer won&#039;t have a Jumbo Joe-type grumpy -pants relationship with Sid by then? I&#039;m trying to go through any channel I can to see how these two have dealt with each other as rivals on the ice, but there&#039;s like no evidence.

As far as tickets go, anyone have a reliable organ-harvesting service contact? Living on one kidney for the rest of my life vs. freezing my butt off in the rain on march 1st in the spaceship by the lake..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So for my birthday at the end of the month, I asked for friends and family to contribute to an orphanage school in Kenya (a friend runs it) instead of giving me gifts. Would it be wrong to take that back and ask for contributions to the Pens/Blackhawks fund?! You&#039;re right. Bad. What was I thinking? I&#039;ll just need to have a second birthday. Cupcakes for everyone!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I cannot possibly express how excited I am about this. Being from the Chicago area I was hoping they&#039;d do a Blackhawks game at Soldier Field but never in my DREAMS though they&#039;d be playing the Pens! Couldn&#039;t have begged for a more perfect outdoor game (mostly because this is exactly the one I would have been begging for).]]></description>
