		<description><![CDATA[In this version of the interview (same interview, but shot from a different angle and it&#039;s a bit longer and we find out who made him laugh at the end!) you can see yellow-ish bits around his jaw area near the cheeks. I&#039;m assuming that&#039;s some bruising but if that&#039;s all the bruising he has a week later, then this man is a miracle!

		<description><![CDATA[When I saw Sid&#039;s press scrum today, I couldn&#039;t help but think of that How I Met Your Mother episode when that character Robin (the Canadian girl who loves hockey) had that quote:

&quot;Look, I come from a culture of hockey players. If a guy can throw down it&#039;s somewhat way hot. And scars? Hello! If a guy&#039;s got a scar, he&#039;s got a Robin, and if he&#039;s missing teeth, I&#039;m missing my pants!&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What?????  You guys amaze me on how you manage to the best &quot;scoop&quot;!!  No one else in the NHL manages to provide an updates on Crosby and you guys find the one picture of him out and about?  

And that pictures is another example of how Crosby is just amazing.  He got hit in the jaw by a puck a week ago, had surgery to fix a broken jaw plus dental work and his face doesn&#039;t look swollen or bruised?  

Crosby&#039;s a god.  Can&#039;t wait to see him back on the ice!  For all that he&#039;s been through the last couple of years and the seasons has had to date, he deserves the Hart and the Cup!]]></description>
