		<description><![CDATA[Having had my jaw broken twice, I&#039;ve pretty much spent the last 4 days grieving in sympathy, talking people off the ledge, and tempering expectations. I seriously feel like I&#039;m going through the recovery all again.

And all the people who are like &quot;What a wimp! Put a cage on and get back other there!&quot;.. no, JUST NO. You have no idea what a broken jaw is like unless you&#039;ve experienced it. And I wouldn&#039;t wish it on anyone. I had to put myself on a Tumblr hiatus lest I lash out at all trolls.

Get well soon, Sid (and Pauly.. and Tanger..). But in the meantime, the guys got this.]]></description>

My brother in law is a die-hard Flyers fan, ManCave and all, so there was ZERO sympathy there.  My huband took pity on me and we left early so I could sob the entire 2 hour drive home.

		<description><![CDATA[I am so happy there are other people as worried as me! I almost thought at one point I was crazy to be so worried about someone I don&#039;t even know, but I CAN&#039;T HELP IT!! It&#039;s Sidney, the most beautiful face in hockey. I have been staying away from reading comments on posts because of the nasty trolls who write dumb/mean shit! They make my inner fighter come out, snappin my fingers saying &#039;oh no you didn&#039;t!&#039; He will be back soon! Until then, I am glad to know I am not alone in thinking my whole world caved in!!]]></description>
