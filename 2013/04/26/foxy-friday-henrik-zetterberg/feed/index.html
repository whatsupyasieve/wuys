		<description><![CDATA[So nice to see one of the Red Wings finally getting a little love on this blog! You will be in for some nice eye candy when they move to the Eastern Conference. Zata (his nickname in Sweden) is not only adorable, and talented, but an incredibly nice guy. Whether you like the Red Wings or not, you gotta admit we have had a hat trick of hotness in our captains for the last TWENTY-SIX YEARS: Steve Yzerman, Nick Lidstrom, and now Henrik Zetterberg. I admit it, we&#039;re spoiled.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[NO, not even fantastic swedish hair can make me like a Red Wing! I will not succumb to this nonsense, not even for puppies. Also, it took me a full 5 minutes of staring at the picture where Z is wearing the &quot;peace&quot; shirt to notice he was in it because I couldn&#039;t pull my focus away from Tyler Seguin&#039;s arms LOL!]]></description>
