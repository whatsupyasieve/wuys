		<description><![CDATA[Pants, you had me right up until that Rangers comment.  Even if you hate the Rangers, don&#039;t you want to keep watching those Broadway beauties play more hockey?

Rick Nash: awesome lumberjack playoff beard.  Henrik Lundqvist: perfectly groomed playoff beard.  Dan Girardi: steely blue playoff glare.

Admit it... you want more of this.]]></description>

And I&#039;m going to Edmonton for May Long. I&#039;ll hug an Oiler for y&#039;all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really dropped the ball, you guys. And for that I apologize. Too many jokes about packing up a white board and heading to Edmonton, not enough follow through.

But let me make it up to you..

How I&#039;m going to spend my summer:
- Saving all my (now non-existant Canadian) pennies for a trip to Edmonton next season.
- Recruiting members to #TeamJSchultz.
- Photoshopping Amanda and myself into that picture of Justin and Taylor.
- Catching up on all the sleep I lost because I live on the east coast and stayed up late to watch every Oilers game.

Please, let that be enough for a playoff spot next season..]]></description>
