		<description><![CDATA[Agree 100% with you Pants! Love WUYS&#039;s posts; the sarcastic, satirical, downright hilarious posts, but today you were just pissed and I don&#039;t blame you. These guys have to remember that what they say will be all over social media in a split second and should at least TRY to think before they utter words. It does suck when someone makes that kind of money and still chooses to be an asshole, but some people just ARE assholes. Just remember DK, the Pens are comin&#039; for ya!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Part of me wants to give Segs a pass. I know that&#039;s some bias coming into play, but also because he&#039;s young and will make mistakes. The other part of me counters: Being young is no excuse. Not in this day and age.

I had the same thought as Alison though. Even if he used it not thinking about the actual context, it&#039;s in his vocabulary and most likely, it&#039;s used amongst his friends. And that&#039;s sad. 

Personally, I&#039;ve actually asked very close friends to stop using the word &quot;gay&quot; to describe things. As in, &quot;OMG! That&#039;s so gay!&quot; Unfortunately, so many people use that word in this context and they&#039;re not thinking about how derogatory it really is.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the problem with the Keith comment is that, as Pants put it, it was &quot;so conversationally desperate&quot;.. it was the easy response route to take when there&#039;s a room full of males and you don&#039;t like the question a female reporter is trying, however badly, to ask. Just because it&#039;s easy for your brain to go there, doesn&#039;t mean the words out of your mouth should follow.

And with Seguin, the problem is that that phrase is in his vocabulary at all. If he&#039;s tweeting it, he&#039;s probably said it, without thinking about what it actually means and why it&#039;s hurtful. And that&#039;s, thankfully, where You Can Play steps in. It will be a learning moment for Tyler, which I think is great.

All of that said, obviously, everyone makes mistakes in the things we say. We own them. We learn from them. We all move on.  

(I hope this didn&#039;t come off as rude or dismissive, I definitely wasn&#039;t trying to be.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good post.

If he had said that to someone of a different race implying that they couldn&#039;t understand/play hockey while simultaneously unnecessarily bringing up their race that would obviously be considered disgustingly racist and it should be. Why is bringing up gender when it is irrelevant considered any different?

As for Seguin, it&#039;s not just that saying something like that is wrong; the fact that he thinks like that (and thinks about it enough to write it which takes it to another level) implies he thinks in a discriminatory manner. These comments don&#039;t come from nowhere - you don&#039;t write things even when you&#039;re sleepy if you don&#039;t believe them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not trying to dismiss anything, but I honestly think that people are getting a little too sensitive. The reporter couldn&#039;t handle her own, she chickened out and was trying to get out of asking the question, until Keith called her out. What he said wasn&#039;t great, but they had just lost their worst game of the year, and she was asking a stupid question. Women in &quot;traditionally male&quot; professions have a lot to overcome, and are held to much higher standards because of it. If you&#039;re gonna ask the tough questions, just do it, don&#039;t back out like this woman did. You&#039;re right in that he had no business saying what he did, but listening to this woman failing at her interview just makes me cringe as well. I&#039;m disappointed in Duncs, but this &quot;reporter&quot; makes me angry. Listen to the full audio here http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/hockey/blackhawks/chi-duncan-keith-audio-20130423,0,816349.mp3file

As for Seguin, he&#039;s young and made a very minor gaff in a very public domain. Unfortunately for him, he&#039;s a superstar and someone always has to make a big deal out of it. He&#039;s young and he&#039;ll eventually learn not to sleep-tweet, but until then it&#039;s pretty clear that he didn&#039;t mean anything by it, he was just trying to promote his friend.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I saw and heard the audio, I don&#039;t know-- I think Keith was being a dick, but not sexist, because it felt like the female comment wasn&#039;t actually directly related to the &quot;know the game&quot; part, as cause and effect. He&#039;d have said the same thing to a male reporter, too. It felt more like, &quot;Yeah, you&#039;d be the first female ref,&quot; then when she interrupted him to say she can&#039;t skate, that triggered the second train of thought, i.e. &quot;You don&#039;t know what you&#039;re talking about&quot; regarding playing the game. 

I don&#039;t know. I like Keith, he&#039;s one of my favorites, but it&#039;s not like it&#039;s his first time being something of an dick. 

As for him, Seguin and all the hockey players for that matter, I figure they&#039;re human, and they&#039;re competitive, and sometimes they&#039;re going to be dumb assholes, same as any other human. Too bad they have a microphone in their face when they do it.]]></description>
