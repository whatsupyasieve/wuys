		<description><![CDATA[Rhonda, Sunshine is in the videos, too! Also awkwardly chatting with fans &#038; signing autographs, in Episode 2 with BSutts, Pauly, &#038; Simon. Hilarious that he can&#039;t get the golf ball onto the tee in the snow globe!! 
 Time to bust this out again: O-M-GENO!!! &quot;Why you in Turkey? Come to Pittsburgh.&quot; Hahahahaha SO cute. 
 Apparently, Sid also went into a fan&#039;s basement Pens&#039; Cave &#038; they said he came back upstairs looking impressed. After seeing his awkwardness in this video, is it ANY wonder that he&#039;s the King of Awkward Pockets?!?! 
 Happy Birthday, Jordo my love! Sorry I missed your day. I still miss that boy with all my little heart. It&#039;s time to buy my JoStaal Canes shersey. 
 As for the tweet, you KNOW I couldn&#039;t let that one pass by without alerting WUYS to the awesomeness &#038; hilarity! 
 Also, despite the sobriety of today as we remember &#038; reflect, it&#039;s also the beginning of HOCKEY CAMP for my beloved Penguins!!! Couldn&#039;t be more excited that the Boys are BACK!!! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[James Neal, having pictures taken with and signing a baby.  Pascal Dupis, playing hockey with a toddler.  MA Fluery, playing goalie with a little girl in a cheerleader outfit.  Geno telling a baby to remember his face because he&#039;ll be back next year. Paul Martin cooing over a baby.  Good Lord, if having another kid is what it is going to take to have any of the Pens show up at my house with season ticket, I&#039;m going to check to see if I&#039;m ovulating!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[She *literally* cannot believe James Neal is signing a onesie because either can you? I can&#039;t believe I just typed those words. 

John TavAIRes...your &quot;workout&quot; video? I kept trying to enter my credit card and it was rejected. The Islanders said that sh*t was available for FREE. MADNESS. Guess I&#039;ll have to order a Captain John shirt instead...]]></description>
