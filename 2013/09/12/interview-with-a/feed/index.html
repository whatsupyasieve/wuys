		<description><![CDATA[I failed to also mention... Those Eyes. Sigh...I guarantee than when masked up? Whether NYR or his beloved Tre Kronor. Heck, he could don a mask of ANY team anywhere... I&#039;d still know it was him. Those Eyes are just that unique, expressive, amazing. Damn, I&#039;m gushing, aren&#039;t, I?  Ok, back to fantasies of neck sucking... Yours or mine, Handsome?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Pants! Like Brenda this was a much needed lift in the middle of a bad week. This is now my second favorite WUYS post of all time! Henrik&#039;s Foxy Friday post will always be my favorite. I had just revisited it yesterday to give me a respite in my bad day. You hit the nail on the head when you said looking at him makes you feel fluffy and happy. I certainly have a smile on my face, and I&#039;ve pulled my hair up so my neck is free for biting in case Henrik wonders by.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pants, in the midst of a very rough week, this post was a much-needed bright spot, so I thank you.

My favorite part of this post is of course, the annual feasting on the blood of the Capitals in the playoffs.  The piano pic caption is a close second.

Like Mandy, I am also available to be bitten at any time that would be convenient for Henrik (and I&#039;m conveniently located in NYC!).  And like Pants, I am now going to put Bloodletting on repeat.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If True Blood has taught me anything, it&#039;s that Swedish vampires are the best vampires.

PS - *standing ovation* for this post

PPS - I&#039;m sorry, but he looks like an old man in that picture by the golf cart. It&#039;s the vest. And the golf. He&#039;s challenging EStaal for the title of &quot;Everyone&#039;s Grandpa Ever.&quot;]]></description>
