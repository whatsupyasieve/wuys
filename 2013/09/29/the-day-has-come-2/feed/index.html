		<description><![CDATA[If done right, and on the right guy, full sleeves are hot. It also depends on what they have on their arms. Neal just looks like an old hipster with man boobs in that top pic, while Green is a total hottie.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Could you hear me screaming all the way from Calgary??? I still think there&#039;s a ways to go before this beauty is totally finished - looks like Nealer&#039;s just got the outlining done, shading still to come. But for now....

The hair + scruff + tight shirts + full sleeve?

MEOW. x1,000,000]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I completely agree with you. I love sleeves that are well done on guys, but I think Mike Green is pulling it off better than Neal. I think the polo shirts on Neal is not helping support the image of a man with sleeves. I miss Jose Theodore and his tattoos.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Personally, I think sleeve tattoos are extremely sexy on (the right) guys. I am really attracted to this one rock star who has two full sleeves and I am also really attracted to Crosby who is the complete opposite and has none. The fact that I love hockey players and rock stars separately and now certain rockstar traits are crossing over to the hockey world, I&#039;m on a bit of sensory overload! I will say this though, while sleeves are sexy, I&#039;m not sure how I feel about them on Neal. Mike Green on the other hand, wowza!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wasn&#039;t that happy to see it, either. My reaction was, &quot;No! NO!! Don&#039;t do that...Why?!&quot; I don&#039;t think it&#039;s finished, either. In some photos, it looks incomplete, like it&#039;s only on the outside of his arm so far. I&#039;ll join you. UGH.]]></description>
