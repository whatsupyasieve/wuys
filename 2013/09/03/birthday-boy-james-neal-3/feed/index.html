		<description><![CDATA[I LOVED the Sassy Nealsy tweet over Crosby-gate!!! Couldn&#039;t stop laughing &#038; that was the day he won Twitter. He&#039;d already won my heart long before. 

Where does one get their hands on that window cling?!?!? I has a need. :)

P.S. Tanger tweeted last night about his &quot;last night out with the boys&quot; in Mtl, which means he&#039;ll be back in Pgh very soon! Plus, Nealer skated at Southpointe yesterday (according to Shelly Anderson of the PG). The boys are starting to migrate home &#038; that makes me SQUEEEEEE!!]]></description>

Happy birthday James! I ask &quot;#isitoctoberyet?&quot; on a daily basis mostly so I can see that HAIR and that STUBBLE and that SASS and those TATS on a regular basis. We&#039;ve missed everything Nealer around here.]]></description>
