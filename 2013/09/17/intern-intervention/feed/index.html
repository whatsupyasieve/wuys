		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s my thing: Everyone in the Twitterverse gives Bieber shit for doing the same exact thing as TSwift, but she can do it because she&#039;s a girl?!? Um, just NO. I&#039;m not a fan of either of them and it drives me crazy to see these two doing this jersey whoring! If they were true fans of the game, they&#039;d pick a team (or two) and be loyal. My celebrity examples of how you hockey: Matthew Perry (grew up a &#039;Nucks fan but has supported the Kings for years), Michael Keaton (ALWAYS a fan of Pittsburgh teams because he&#039;s a hometown boy), and even CM Punk (wore a Hawks jersey at the wrestling thing last night).  Also, let&#039;s not forget the gone-too-soon Cory Monteith, whose death the &#039;Nucks even tweeted their sadness about because they KNEW he was a lifelong fan!!
Now, I don&#039;t have an issue with people liking more than one team - hell, I do, too! But. I AM somewhat of a loyalist when it comes to jerseys and I will only ever own them of my #1 team! Sherseys of favorite players on other teams, though? I&#039;m definitely in there....looking at you JoStaal, BRyan (Ducks, NOT Sens!!), Captain Serious, &#038; Captain Cally!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m pretty sure Jeff and his girlfriend were at the same TSwift/Ed Sheeran concert this summer that I was at. Hey universe, unless you&#039;re going to arrange for me to bump into them, please stop putting all my favourite players at the same concerts as me. So close, yet so far away.

PS - Jeff and Ed Sheeran - I very much approve of this friendship. And I&#039;m going to go listen to Lego House now.]]></description>
