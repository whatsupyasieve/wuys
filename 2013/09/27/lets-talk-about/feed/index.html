		<description><![CDATA[Those gifs captured all the sass. mm. My only complaint is that you asked mostly yes/no questions, which we know doesn&#039;t keep him talking! Or lips moving.. talking, lips, same thing.

And Lilo - I had the same feeling. As a native Floridian, I feel he would be very in cognito down South. I remember being extremely frustrated growing up 30 min outside of Tampa with people who didn&#039;t know who Vinny was. Seriously?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, Kathryn Tappen--you need that job. You would clearly do it right. Even the men would watch. Nobody ever asks the questions that really need answering!

The folding chair and Halloween costume ones made me howl.

He should vacation in Florida, where I&#039;m pretty sure that until recently, people were asking which school he played football for. (I can say that as a native Floridian.) As for the moisturizer, I know the answer to that. His poor dear face gets tenderized by pucks, sticks, and elbows!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sidney must adopt a black cat, maybe even two.  It would be a nice gesture on his part. Black cats at shelters are sometimes overlooked because of people&#039;s superstitions. 
I would happily volunteer to cat-sit for him when he&#039;s on the road. It would be a bit of a commute for me, but I think I could manage it.]]></description>
