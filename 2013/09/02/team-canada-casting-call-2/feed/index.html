		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry, but I kind of WANT that rose ceremony shirt. Get me a bowl of popcorn for when they announce Team Canada because sh*t.is.gonna.get.real.

As for Jordan...that ain&#039;t no bleach. Demi god right there. It isn&#039;t going to stop hurting until the NHL store stops selling his Penguins gear. Maybe we can stop that now, maybe guys? It&#039;s only been 15 months?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you pick Jonathan Toews over Mike Richards - in this, or during the playoffs - you will get a phone call from my grandma detailing exactly why you are wrong.

PS Jordan Staal, you still make my heart hurt. I&#039;ll never be over it.]]></description>
