		<description><![CDATA[I went to the very first Caps Convention in 2009. The organizers didn&#039;t have all the logistics down pat that first year, and wrote on your wristband in Sharpie which autograph session you got. 

I analyzed and studied the itinerary so I could narrow down which session Mike would be in. To my dismay, each session was broken down into A, B, and C, so it was a crap shoot.

I ended up getting B, and he was in C, but because I refused to be denied the chance to see Mike Green up close, I went into the bathroom and stealthily changed my wristband letter.

I was so terrified that they&#039;d kick me out of line, but at that point in the day, the kids working the lines could not care less. After I got past them, I was then afraid I&#039;d pass out before I got to him.

I did not pass out, got a puck signed, and was able to carry on a little conversation with him. Best day ever.]]></description>
