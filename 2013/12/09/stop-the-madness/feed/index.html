		<description><![CDATA[Honestly, that game was diabolical, and Bergeron is my favourite player on the Bruins, because he&#039;s one of the nicest guys around. I just wish that this whole thing didn&#039;t happen. Both teams lost great players, and I wish this never happened.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thornton plays a tough game and will thrown down if needed, but he&#039;s not a goon.  I think that he prides himself on playing a clean, albeit physical game, which is why I think that he was so broken up about the situation in the post-game interview. It was a terrible, momentary lapse in judgment.  I&#039;m not excusing his behavior but I do think he is contrite.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seeing Bergeron pulling the stretcher over to Orpik brought a tear to my eyes!  Watching this unfold live was gut-wrenching, but this little glimmer of chivalry reminded me how great both these teams can be.  Here&#039;s to a better match in the postseason!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Completely agree here! That goal and Bergy&#039;s reaction was amazing. And hitting them on the scoreboard is the RIGHT way to do it! Also, How was that Phaneuf hit NOT a penalty?!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bergeron is such a class act. Always has been, and always will be, I&#039;m sure! Thank God for him. Both as a player and a person.
Sadly, I also never thought I would ever see Thornton do anything like that! And I like Neal, but that knee, omg…And his comments after the game were just as bad... 
I think these two teams momentarily forgot what the game is all about for sure. The reffing didn&#039;t help. Between the non-calls and not being able to control anything going on around them, it&#039;s awful. He&#039;s hoping whenever they meet next it&#039;s a TOTALLY different experience...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Having been watching the game at a bar--which means I really wasn&#039;t able to watch--I watched the videos and listened to commentary tonight on NBCSN. 

As a Bruins fan, I like Shawn Thornton. His style of play does serve a purpose in today&#039;s game, but that doesn&#039;t mean I condone fighting or what he did. I&#039;m surprised to find out that in all his years of professional hockey he isn&#039;t a &quot;repeat offender.&quot;

Watching the replay of his punches to Orpik and seeing the moment Orpik loses consciousness, that was scary. I just can&#039;t imagine--and hope I never find out--what it&#039;s like to be punched (ever), but especially to the point of losing consciousness. 

As for James Neal, I&#039;m not a Penguins fan, but I like him and want him to do well. What he did flabbergasted me. Again, I was surprised to find out he *is* a repeat offender. 

It was a bad game for both teams and it just makes me really nervous the next time they play--which looks like it&#039;ll be the playoffs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Anyone who knows me can affirm that I am adamantly not a fan of either team, but that game still left me feeling sick.  Neal&#039;s actions were petulant and unnecessary, while Thornton&#039;s were borderline criminal.  Those players reactions actions as shown in post game interviews shows the truth of their character, though.  I&#039;m sure ST22 will continue to feel terrible for what he did to a man he calls a friend while he sits for what will undoubtedly be a LONG time...maybe he can give Nealer some pointers on humility and repentance, because I sadly think the his 5 game time out will be lost on him.

Bergy, however, continues to be a prince]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We have a family friend that&#039;s a referee for various levels in the Chicagoland area.  We had a conversation during the Playoffs about all the borderline hits and blatant crosschecks that weren&#039;t being called, and he was pissed.  I don&#039;t blame him.  It was actually a lot like this:  The rage level in youth sports is kind of getting out of control anyways.  I can&#039;t imagine what seeing things like this does.  

Also, I was at the Chicago Wolves v. OKC Barons game on Saturday night.  They brought in 4 or 5 local elementary school choirs to sing before the game, and the kids got to watch the game for free.  Any time two guys started chirping after a play the kids started calling for a fight.  Granted, a few fights did break out, but multiple times a period you could hear these kids yelling &quot;Fight! Fight! Fight!&quot;  I took my 8 year old cousin, and can&#039;t decide whether or not it was a good thing that he was more interested in Sour Patch Kids and cotton candy than the game...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think its unbelievable that ultimately hockey is just a game.  Maybe because I&#039;m in sports medicine and around it all the time I&#039;ve grown used to it and forget how intense it can be.  But even when the Cup is involved, this is just a game.  To intentionally target someone&#039;s head (both Nealer and Thornton) is completely inexcusible in my mind.  I&#039;m a lot like Pants; all aboard the NealMobile!  But I&#039;m so mad at him right now.  And to sit there and not own up to the fact that you effed up is completely classless (it pains me to say that). 

That being said, I was also a bit of a Thornton fan.  My first hockey game was a Pens/Bruins game from 2008.  I was the giggling teenager at the glass watching warm ups and Shawn kept shooting pucks in my direction (I&#039;d squeal out of terror and sheer excitement every time they hit the glass mind you) and he&#039;d giggle.  Those kinds of experiences are what make this game so great.  I have a theory that typically the more violent the sport/player the nicer they are in real life.  Hockey players are some of the nicest guys I&#039;ve ever met and ever worked with.  That in mind, I will never be a Thornton fan again.  He can talk all he wants about &quot;the Code&quot;.  But he did what he did; and I don&#039;t see any way that his intent wasn&#039;t to send Orpik to the hospital. Despite what he tells the media.  

Just some of my thoughts, because I think my friends are getting sick of hearing about it. lol]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bergeron give me hope for hockey humanity.

Last night&#039;s Leafs/Bruins game had some questionable calls and non-calls (like Phaenuf on Miller) and Bergeron responds like a boss.  Comes out of the box, scores the ENG. Shrugs. NBD. 

THAT is how you respond.  Hurt &#039;em where it hurts most - the scoreboard.]]></description>
