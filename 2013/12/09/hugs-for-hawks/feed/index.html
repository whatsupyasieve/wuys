		<description><![CDATA[WHY AREN&#039;T THE RANGERS DOING A DOG CALENDAR?!?!  We totally could&#039;ve gotten that done if Torts was still here.

OK, maybe Lundqvist, Girardi, Nash, Pyatt, Hagelin, et al with puppies would be too much to handle, but if I have to die, that wouldn&#039;t be a bad way to go.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t care if this calendar (per Amanda Bickell&#039;s tweet) costs me $150 to buy and ship. I will have it. I may technically be a cat person, but my love for Crawford and Bollig is strong. Besides, this would be the mature way to plaster pictures of these men on my walls all while masking my 13-year-old self&#039;s crush on them.]]></description>
