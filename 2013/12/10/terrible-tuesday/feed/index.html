		<description><![CDATA[It was one strange game.  first period, Green kept getting penalities, and although I don&#039;t know you, I thought of you immediately.

So I&#039;m basking in the glory of the Bolts maybe just winning one of these days and wondering, where&#039;s Ovi?  Is he out hurt or sick?  

Then second period happens and Ovi is like the only player needed on the ice.  He was a crazy sniping machine!

My poor Bolts!  :(]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bleh i hate Ovie! as a Pens fan, i&#039;d love for him to stop scoring this season and let my Crosby and Malkin take the scoring titles! he&#039;s an arrogant p****, he&#039;s had enough scoring titles in my opinion.... -___- let someone else score more goals than you, Ovie, for once ugh.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is sad when your fans boo you, Mike Green. Please do not do that again. I still eat too much mac &#038; cheese, so I know that you are correct in your time assessment. Now to happier things, Ovechkin and Backstrom. Let me just say that they shouldn&#039;t wait until there is only 32 seconds left to play to score and tie the game. I have high blood pressure and that certainly didn&#039;t help it. My dog is traumatized because of how much I was screaming and jumping off of the couch. He is hiding in my bedroom now. I can&#039;t even say anything worthy of how amazing Ovechkin and Backstrom have been this season. Sorry to Holtby for Mike Green&#039;s inability to keep his stick down and THANK YOU Grubauer for a great performance. I love hockey!!!!]]></description>
