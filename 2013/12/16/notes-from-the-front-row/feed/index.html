		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been convinced for awhile now that plane tickets to Florida and front row seats to a Panthers game would be cheaper than the $11 Alewife parking/T ride fees and a ticket to the Bruinsâ€¦.never did I think to drive the 4 1/2 hours to NYâ€¦
And being so sick and then being in a car for 3 hoursâ€¦.Go Pants!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pants! 1. I hope you&#039;re feeling better.  2. You beautiful genius, you.  I am now shopping for Hawks/Isles tix for Jan 2nd.  This solves my problem of torn loyalties if I were to get tix to the Rangers/Hawks.  This will rival the awesomeness that was 10th row Rangers/Stars in Dallas in Nov &#038; Frozen Frontier this past weekend.

		<description><![CDATA[I have front row tickets for when the Pens come to Buffalo in February. I&#039;ve never been front row before so I didn&#039;t know what to expect, so I liked reading your view on it. I hope it&#039;s good! We&#039;re on the side the Pens warm up on (obv). Thanks for the advice on it being colder because the Buffalo arena is always freezing even like 20 rows up from the ice!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Loved the description (sorry you were ill that day!) of what life really is like in those front-row seats.  Sometimes I envy the people that are sitting there, but now I wonder? I am 5&#039;6&quot; and if I had been in your seat, I probably would be even more a Hobbit than you were.  What will the new arena--the Barclay--be like? On a side note the price for your ticket was ridiculous! None of my tickets that I got for the Flames, Oilers, and Jets this season were under $100 and they are all way up in the nosebleed/vertigo/need binoculars sections.  There&#039;s something to be said to be in a poor NHL market--getting to see up close teams like the Captials, Penguins, Leafs, and Blackhawks for just $50!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just saw my first close-up Islanders game - from the seventh row or so, and I actually kind of enjoyed the limited view of the action - only because I tend to get SO TENSE at Islanders games that anything that allows me to disassociate from the action a little bit is kind of good. But um, more healthily engaged sports fans&#039; mileage may vary.

I&#039;ve always wondered about that bench-adjacent seat, though - thanks for the report! (And god bless NVMC prices, right?? Siiiiigh. Good to hear that other rinks are not quite as cold, though really I think the only thing I won&#039;t miss is the lack of bathrooms.)

		<description><![CDATA[I totally agree, Pants. Having experienced sitting somewhat that close (4th or 5th row at a couple CBJ games), you end up watching the JumboTron most of the time. 

That said, I&#039;ve got 5th row seats to the CBJ v LOS game in January. I&#039;m taking my parents because of Anze Kopitar (we&#039;re Slovenian â€¦ he&#039;s Slovenian â€¦. He and my dad are from the same hometown and my dad actually knows one of Anze&#039;s neighbors). It&#039;ll be the first time for both of them going to an NHL game. I can&#039;t wait to hear my mom&#039;s reaction the first time the puck or bodies slam against the boards. I just know her reaction is going to be glorious! :)]]></description>
