		<description><![CDATA[Absolutely! 
The only (minor) party foul was both James and Geno chewing with their mouths open. The major party foul was, of course, James&#039; actions during the Bruins game.

As for the glasses, where are Geno&#039;s? I distinctly remember WUYS posting some photos of Geno wearing glasses when he was in Russia over the summer. Yaaayyyyyyy :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My Twitter feed melted down over those glasses last night, and then the men of Penguins Nation started to get jealous. Then I had to explain to some non-Pens tweeps that when a good-looking hockey player puts on glasses, a hormone hurricane ensues. It was hilarious. I wonder if Paul Martin and/or Dan Bylsma helped him pick his frames?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Guuuuuurrrrl, No.  I don&#039;t care how dreamy you may think he looks in his glasses. You cannot so quickly forget how much he hurt you and his team with his actions. I know that you always make passes at boys who wear glasses but this time, you have to be mad at him for at least a little bit longer.  He needs to do more to to win back your love.  He doesn&#039;t deserve you.  Not yet, at least.]]></description>
