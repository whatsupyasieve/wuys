		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Is he flexing his abs? That can’t be all the time.&quot; It certainly IS the most wonderful time of the year, Pants. I&#039;ve circled February 6th on my Penguins and Paws calendar. Along with every important hockey date the rest of this season. I CAN HARDLY STAND IT!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[SO happy the Rangers have Henrik locked up.  I&#039;m considering this an early birthday present from the Rangers.  Also, if you haven&#039;t seen it yet, Henrik has a new Welcome to Rangerstown commercial, and it&#039;s pretty great.  At home with Henrik, you say?
