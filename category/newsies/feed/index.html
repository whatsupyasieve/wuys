				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The playoffs are a tough time, when I want all my favorite players to have transcendent, legendary, career-making experiences&#8230; while their teams still lose. But someone has to win every round, and so it may as well have happened like this:</p>
<p>John Tavares, middle school science teacher, registered tax lawyer and upholder of dad-styles, scores to tie the game with 53 seconds left, giving his team the chance to clinch their first playoff series victory in 23 years.</p>

<p>Then John wins the game in double OT &#8211; which is waaaaaay past his bedtime, y&#8217;all.</p>

<p>Now when we write a Disney movie based on this blog, it&#8217;ll just be clips of last night.</p>
<p>I hope John celebrated wildly after the win. That he rushed out without even ironing his shirt collar, then drank ice tea, but in a pint glass so it looked like beer.</p>

<p>As mentioned, the Isles last won a playoff series in 1993. As a Pens fan, I remember this victory &#8211; it ended Pittsburgh&#8217;s bid for a third-straight Cup. John does not remember: he was 2 years old. I consoled myself by blasting <em>The Bodyguard</em> soundtrack and singing along to Whitney Houston in the shower &#8211; because it was the #1 album, and I wasn&#8217;t old enough to drive.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll soon be back to work, hoping every team (that isn&#8217;t mine) loses every single game. Two losers per series, zero winners, except the Penguins. Such is my playoff bloodlust that I would bend the rules of reality to my will. But for now, I&#8217;m taking a moment to be happy for John, because you know this is his wildest, lifelong dream of an aw-shucks moment.</p>

<p>Until I tried it. And the problems began.</p>
<ul>
<li>Josi vs Gabe the Babe in the first round?! Can I just win the loser and go home happy?</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t know 60% of the Pacific Division contenders. They play hockey past my bedtime.</li>
<li>Tyler Seguin vs. Patrick Sharp? Like, you&#8217;re teammates on the train to the Capital, but once you hit the arena, it&#8217;s every handsome man for himself? I hope they refuse at the end and hold hands.</li>
<li>Paul Martin made the bracket? Hey San Jose!</li>
<li>Sidney Crosby vs. Jared Boll. Prince Charming vs. the Wicked Queen&#8217;s eyebrows.</li>
<li>And then it was over. NO STAMKOS? NO TAVARES? What kind of rigged crap is this?</li>

<p>So, I created a real, better bracket for us. With the help of everyone on Twitter during the Pens/Caps game last night, we present to you&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>WUYS NHL Man Madness 2016</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s not perfect. I had to pick someone from every team, which meant only a few teams could send multiple handsome faces. Many competed, few made the bracket. I divided East vs West and used a random generator to seed the players.  The rest, as they say, is up to you.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://surveyplanet.com/56ef31b2493d480c1bf136be">VOTE HERE: WUYS NHL Man Madness 2016 Bracket Challenge</a> </strong>(You don&#8217;t have to enter your email. Just hit Begin.)</p>
<p>UPDATE: If you voted before 10PM EST on Sunday night, I forgot to include Jamie Benn vs. Jordan Eberle. Probably because that&#8217;s like choosing cake or a different cake. I mean, how can you want just one? You can try here, in <strong><a href="https://surveyplanet.com/56ef55a35a3845081e47e763">Oops, Jamie Benn vs Jordan Eberle</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>You have until Wednesday night to vote</strong>, and we&#8217;ll move into the Semifinals on Thursday!</p>

<p>Mamma mia. Lip sync battle is the greatest entertainment invention since the Puppy Bowl, and that&#8217;s even when Beyonce doesn&#8217;t show up. It&#8217;s also the highest art form I participate in daily. From my car.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s be honest. I don&#8217;t know who any of these Canucks rookies are. And I am generally terrified of potential humiliation, so watching this was not easy! But I know all these songs and I must say, these guys nailed it.</p>

<p>Jake Virtanen did Alan Jackson&#8217;s &#8220;Chattahoochee&#8221; in a pair of pants that maybe fit him in high school. Good thing he didn&#8217;t pick a song with any booty-dropping or we&#8217;d have seen somebody&#8217;s Chattahoochee.</p>

<p>Jared McCann (hi cutie!) went straight for our own hearts with some BSB. God, I love this song. It makes no sense &#8211; are they happy? Sad? They never want to hear us say we want it that way? But I thought they <em>did</em> want it that way?</p>

<p>Ben Hutton went all out with his choice of Aqua&#8217;s &#8220;Barbie Girl.&#8221; He was approximately a fetus when this song was released (okay, he was 4), but clearly this musical milestone resonates across the generations.</p>

<p>Last, in the always-unfortunate slot after someone unbottons clothing, Sven Baertschi hit us with some Marvin Gaye. He doesn&#8217;t really know what the host is saying, or what the words are, or that he&#8217;s dressed like AJ McLean, so I assumed he&#8217;d be the one singing Backstreet Boys. Throw is some skating-ish dance moves and you&#8217;ve got yourself a fine performance, friend.</p>

<p>There was no winner, though I think Sven had it in the bag with his turtleneck and chain. Did he confuse Marvin Gaye with The Lonely Island? I almost hope he did. I also hope more teams subject their players to forced participation for our amusement soon. Right after they give Chuck and I a good twenty minutes with that goal-sized wine rack.</p>
<p>So, in summary, you should vote for Canada. They&#8217;re the country of hockey-themed liquor cabinets and freestyle dancing by untrained white men. If that&#8217;s not the place for me and Chuck, then just leave us the wine.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I pity the fool who answers the NHL TV customer service line when I call today. Well, the person won&#8217;t be a fool, nor can they actually do anything about the disaster of a changeover from Game Center Live. But still. I don&#8217;t pay $150 a year to miss Sidney Crosby hat tricks!</p>
<p>Last night, Sid scored three very necessary goals to lead the Penguins to a 6-5 victory over Ottawa.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/8R00IikN7nM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>I won&#8217;t take credit for this particular scoring surge, but ask Lindsay if it might be the result of a conversation we had yesterday. I once ended the lockout, you know.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is a sign for the Pens, who currently hold the last EC wild card slot. The East is all jammed up: seven teams within two points, and all for third in the division.</p>

<p>On Monday, Sid told press, &#8220;Our playoffs basically start now.&#8221; And he kinda smiled when he said it. [<a href="https://www.nhl.com/penguins/video/off-day-sidney-crosby/t-277443440/c-40680303">Video</a>]</p>

<p>While you were enjoying the Penguins goals and wondering WTAF they were doing between goals, I was practicing yoga with this Sid workout clip.</p>

<p>Then, the Twitters told me that freshly-returned-from-injury Connor McDavid did this:</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/-9ru_R7Qjjo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Well, shit. That is an amazing goal. Tell me again what you were doing in 1997, when he was born? My Home Ec class egg baby is older than Connor McDavid. (Haha, #TeamEggBaby it is!)</p>
<p>Alas, I saw no actual hockey AGAIN. I will be sending this post to the suggestion box at NHL TV &#8211; which probably does work, because obviously.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Obviously the big story of the weekend was John Scott auditioning to play himself in the Disney remake of <em>Goon</em>. He not only went to Nashville, apprently against the NHL&#8217;s wishes, he owned the weekend. His kids and goals and his MVP award are all the things we love about sports. Perseverance, faith and, hey, talent (!) delivered with a smile that thanked most people and told some others to kiss his ass.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The support of so many players and teams for Scott&#8217;s efforts was also spectacular. Sportsmanship, alive and well! This is what sports should teach kids: not that everybody wins, or gets a trophy for showing up, but that life can be tough &#8211; and you can be tougher.  Scott goes, for now, back to the AHL. Fate awaits. But for that moment, when someone said he couldn&#8217;t, John Scott did anyway. Bravo, sir.</p>

<p>HI GUYS! Remember me? I was wondering if after all these years you&#8217;d like to meet and go over half a season of hockey that I&#8217;ve mostly missed. How does this happen? My life is like space in <em>Interstellar</em>, where time barely passes, while hockey and this blog remain on Earth, getting 80 years older every day without me.</p>
<p>So, All-Star Game?</p>
<p>Is anyone watching this? I kinda sorta almost totally forgot about it until someone mentioned John  Tavares&#8217; pants.</p>

<p>So, Crosby didn&#8217;t get invited. That&#8217;s old news. I wrote a mental blog post called &#8220;10 Things Sid Can Do Instead of the ASG&#8221;, which was quite funny.  You should read it sometime when you develop mind-reading powers.  Or tomorrow, if I get around to posting it.</p>
<p>The newer news is Ovi and Toews are hurt/sick and also suspended. The NHL sure knows how to cry when the whole class doesn&#8217;t come to their party.</p>

<p>Alas, with no drunken draft, most of the fun is gone from the weekend anyway. The NHL has realized this too late and made some replacement efforts to attract our attention:</p>
<p><strong>1) Made John Tavares captain.</strong> He probably suggested this <em>Footloose</em>-inspired sobriety nonsense, for fear a real charitable organization might think Ovi was actually poor and needed a new car. The paperwork on that tax headache!  But it does mean more camera time for Captain T and the Pleated Pants.</p>

<p><strong>4) 3-on-3 Format.</strong> I won&#8217;t pretend to have an opinion on this, as I&#8217;ve watched approximately one OT period all season, but it sounds exciting. Top players + more open ice = more goals, right? But hasn&#8217;t the All-Star Game always ended in some Hobbit score of twelveses to eleventy anyway? Maybe the &#8220;last place in the draft&#8221; prize can be repurposed to the only player who doesn&#8217;t score a hat trick on Sunday.</p>

<p><strong>5) The John Scott story.</strong> Voted into the ASG by fans, then traded and assigned to the AHL, the saga of whether or not John Scott would appear in the ASG has been ongoing news. Yesterday, Scott published<a href="http://www.theplayerstribune.com/a-guy-like-me/"> this first person account in The Player&#8217;s Tribune</a>. In it, he explains how someone from the NHL encouraged him, even now, not to attend this weekend&#8217;s events.</p>
<p>SCREW YOU, NHL. Wrong, bad, stupid, and also, WHY? John Scott may be the only player who actually cares about this game, and you think he should stay home? Do you think the fans who voted him in should not watch? Oh no, you want them. You NEED them.</p>

<p>Read the Player&#8217;s Tribune story. It will make you want to buy a John Scott jersey and stand up in your living room when he takes the ice on Sunday. I hope every player shows up wearing his name. You may not like Scott&#8217;s brand of hockey, but it is part of hockey. Scott may not be an elite player, but he is a player. Was a player? Will be an NHL player again? Who knows. But if you love the game, you have to love it&#8217;s scars.</p>
<p>So, see you guys tomorrow night on the Twitters to techno-judge the real skills at Skills Competition: hair, beard, sass? Our trifecta of All-Star Weekend talents.</p>

<p>With weeks to go until New Year’s Day and its symbolic game, this year’s <em>Road to the NHL Winter Classic</em> is back on EPIX, this time trying to give us a glimpse of the lives of the Montreal Canadiens and the Boston Bruins.</p>
<p>If you don’t know, this is a rivalry for the ages. One of &#8211; if not the &#8211; most bitter in the NHL. To this day, these teams have faced each other more than any other two teams in the league, and they simply really, <em>really</em> dislike each other.</p>

	<p class="wp-caption-text">The kids who spawned a thousand memes.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me be honest &#8211; I’m a Bruins fan, inclined to turn a side-eye to every bit of the show that is about the Habs. Yet even I have to admit that if there’s one thing this first episode of <em>Road the the NHL Winter Classic</em> did well, it was keeping the focus on a player that it is almost impossible to hate: PK Subban.</p>
<div id="attachment_22561" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

	<p class="wp-caption-text">Related: PK as Don Cherry makes Strombo pee his pants. [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPd4FIiGt1s">Video</a>]</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s a beautiful moment, in the opening for the Habs’ section of the show, where PK putting on the most outrageous red fur coat. My friends and I couldn’t help but wonder, does he dress like that all the time, or is it just for the cameras? We could <em>completely</em> believe he wears this thing out every day.</p>

	<p class="wp-caption-text">Echoes of his <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZhaPJ3u3JAhVGGh4KHfYGCt8QjRwIBw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmontrealgazette.com%2Fsports%2Fhockey%2Fnhl%2Fmontreal-canadiens%2Fhabs-p-k-subban-says-hell-dress-like-don-cherry-again&amp;bvm=bv.110151844,d.dmo&amp;psig=AFQjCNGF7LgMKXweAp4Qp1PIUQqf1_4Yyg&amp;ust=1450814291202679">NHL Awards suit</a></p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turns out, the coat <em>is</em> for the cameras, but his teammates fall for the joke and their reactions are glorious.</p>
<p>There’s also this pretty interesting bit where PK lets us in into one of his &#8220;hobbies&#8221;: suit designing. He says it himself, he likes to look good. And he does. Can’t wait to see what he pulls out for the Winter Classic.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/SLAanGdPBA4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Okay, enough Habs. None of this compares to the delightful moments with the Bruins we get to see! From Zdeno Chara walking around Boston, going to his favorite barber (the same one that shaved his playoff beard after winning the Cup, the one Chara brought the Cup to) and stopping by a youth hockey team from Halifax for pictures and autographs, to Brad Marchand soulfully gazing out of his bedroom window before putting on a (very sharp) suit, it’s all pretty intimate.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/AL-dMQV_2Js?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>[<strong>Editors note</strong>: You know I didn&#8217;t write that about Marchand! *P]</p>
<p>But no moment is more intimate that the few minutes we get with Patrice Bergeron. Bergy, flawless, perfect Patrice, is famously known his discretion.  Never would I have expected to see 8-week old baby Zack featured on the show. And yet, this happened&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_22562" style="width: 255px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

			</span>
		</span>
	<p class="wp-caption-text">:: synchronized swoon ::</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So ovaries everywhere imploded in hushed whimpers. The show also featured Stephanie Bergeron gushing about how good a father Patrice is, and I had to rewind and rewatch a couple of times, making pained noises throughout the whole thing.</p>
<p>The preview for the upcoming episodes also seem to show that we’ll be introduced to Tuukka Rask’s tiny blonde Finnish baby, which is something that nobody expected either, because these guys, they don’t share.</p>

	<p class="wp-caption-text">Yankees hat. This kid is good.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mainly, my brain short-circuited post-Bergy and I retained very little of everything else. To be fair, as first episodes go, this one was heavy on exposition. Hopefully they&#8217;ll find the hooks they had least year, like Latta and Wilson&#8217;s bromance, or a bevvy of family holiday skates to pack it all up with cuteness and babies everywhere. I am eagerly awaiting more baby Bergy, and Rask, and the exceptionally cute baby Krejci:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This show has always been at its best when there&#8217;s more than a rivalry narrative to hang onto, so I&#8217;ll look forward to next week&#8217;s show. The Bruins played some good games (sayonara, Penguins!) while Episode 2 was filming. I, for one, will be satisfied with babies everywhere, but I may be easy to please.</p>
<p>[<strong>Thanks, Elodie!</strong> See you next week. *P]</p>

<p>This year, it&#8217;s the Habs vs. the Bruins at Foxboro Stadium in Boston on January 1. EPIX once again has cameras embedded with each team to bring you their 4-part behind the scenes series &#8220;<strong>Road to the NHL Winter Classic</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/gB_JqnhlsS4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>The show premieres tonight at 10/9 Central. You can <strong>watch it LIVE and FREE on <a href="http://www.epixhd.com/">EPIX.com</a></strong>. (I wonder if they got any footage of that &#8220;Frozen&#8221; karaoke video being recorded&#8230; or if we&#8217;ve really seen all we need.)</p>
<p>We are pretty excited &#8211; as is Puck Daddy &#8211; because, let&#8217;s face it, we are hoping for The PK Subban Show. Even Chuck, Bruins fan that she is, can&#8217;t say no to the PK.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/KSQ9Oo_gf1A?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>The Penguins are in Boston tonight for a Wednesday Night Rivalry game, airing on NBC Sports. The &#8220;Road to the Winter Classic&#8221; episode stays available online after it&#8217;s 10 PM airtime, so you can catch it after the game.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As explained by <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/pascal-dupuis-forced-to-end-nhl-career-due-to-medical-condition-203809151.html">Puck Daddy</a>, it&#8217;s not an official retirement because Duper still has years left on his contract with the Penguins. He will go on LTIR for the balance of time.</p>
<p>While this is undoubtedly a smart move, it breaks my little heart. Duper is beyond a fan favorite. He&#8217;s like everyone&#8217;s wacky uncle, and you know holidays will be more stressful without him at the table. He looked out for his teammates, especially awkward Crosby, and always seemed to be looking out for us at the same time.</p>

	<p class="wp-caption-text">Thanks for the memories.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To celebrate Duper, here are my <strong>5 favorite Pascal Dupuis moments</strong>:</p>
<p>1.<strong> PRANKS</strong>: Duper rigged the <a href="http://www.pittsburghmagazine.com/Pittsburgh-Magazine/January-2012/Pascal-Dupuis-Interview/">toilet in their room to hose down Crosby</a> upon flushing. I&#8217;d put money on it being his idea to <a href="http://www.pittsburghmagazine.com/Pittsburgh-Magazine/December-2010/Don-039t-Trust-Sidney-Crosby-with-Your-Car-Keys/">fill Kadar&#8217;s car with styrofoam peanuts</a>. Nealer knew it was Duper when someone <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdjI7m6BP4">tied a tail to his car</a>&#8230; just in time for his NHL 36 special.</p>
<p>2. Which leads us to <strong>HAIR STYLIST</strong>. Bless his sarcastic, teasing heart.</p>
<div id="attachment_22498" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

		<img class="wp-image-22498 size-full" src="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dupuis.gif" alt="dupuis" width="400" height="201" />
			<span class="xc_pin" onclick="pin_this(event, 'http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://whatsupyasieve.com/2015/12/09/say-goodnight-not-goodbye/&amp;media=http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dupuis.gif&amp;description=Say Goodnight, Not Goodbye')">
			</span>
		</span>
	<p class="wp-caption-text">Doing our work for us.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Duper&#8217;s running joke with <strong>DAAAAAAAN Potash</strong>, making every intermission a possible trip to laughland. Like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8QhSP9hws0">this one</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8m5321c3JAhUMXh4KHakIC6wQtwIIJDAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DVFo3znDa1X8&amp;usg=AFQjCNHcTtLfVSNxf1nrD6DDdSktyObEtw">this one</a> and, oh heck, they&#8217;re all my favorites. Here, Duper narrates a compilation like he&#8217;s so proud he got all his teammates in on the master plan.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/u4OTtV_OSuw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>4. And then there&#8217;s <strong>THE BEARD</strong>. I always want the Pens in the Final, and Duper would have been an odds-on Penguin favorite for Beard of the Year.  Here&#8217;s to the pelted manbeard that Crosby&#8217;s babyscruff looked up to all these years.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Of course there&#8217;s <strong>MY FANGIRL MOMENT</strong>. I meet a lot of famous people through my job. Really famous people. And I never get stupid, giddy, stammering excited like I do around hockey players I love.</p>

			</span>
		</span>
	<p class="wp-caption-text">Me, holding it together.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I&#8217;ll really miss most are the days Dupuis-Crosby-Kunitz were <strong>SCORING GOALS</strong> like we eat nachos &#8211; lots of &#8217;em, and as fast as possible. It&#8217;s been a while since this combo clicked, but the Penguins believed in reuniting them as recently as this week. [<a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2015/12/01/Penguins-hope-for-spark-from-Kunitz-Crosby-Dupuis-reunion/stories/201512010100">Post-Gazette</a>]  My stubborn loyalty always believed it too.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/3NbRhVGzIsA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>We wish Duper the best of luck, and hope to see him coaching an aspect of the Pens game very soon. Perhaps improving it. There is certainly room for that right now.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am SO late in posting a recap of one of my favorite hockey games ever! Back on Thrusday, 11/17, the Capitals hosted the red hot (<em>all</em> puns intended) Dallas Stars.</p>
<p>Meet my friend Jess. Isn&#8217;t she pretty? With her red coat and red hair, she could be the Caps mascot&#8230; except they already have one (more on this later).</p>

<p>I recently won a <strong>Caps Ultimate Fan Experience</strong>, and took Jess as my date. The package consists of watching warm-ups from the penalty box, plus two lower-level seats. Which, after watching warm-ups from the penalty box, seem like they&#8217;re in the parking lot.</p>
<p>You can buy these ticket packages <a href="http://capitals.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=106249">here</a>. They come with a jersey and run $250+ depending on the game you want. The Stars game was lowest tier. Obviously that schedule was made last season! For a special occasion, or if you wanted to impress your hockey blogger wife (ahem), it&#8217;s pretty darned cool.</p>

<p>How are we ever going to watch warm-ups from anywhere else? Would we ever get used to pucks pinging off the glass non-stop in front of our faces? Maybe if I&#8217;d been looking at the Caps&#8217; side, I&#8217;d have seen those pucks coming. But Jamie Benn was right there.</p>

<p>We moved to our excellent 7th row seats right at the goal line where the Stars shot twice. Now, we were definitely rooting for the Caps, but the Stars have some high-powered offense and it was fun to watch Benn &amp; Seguin connect for a goal up close. If I could teleport, I would have revealed my power to the world when I popped into the middle of their hug.</p>

<p>The already epic night held two more highlights in store. First, I had the pleasure of meeting Erin (<a href="https://twitter.com/ErinMiHaley">@ErinMIHaley</a>) and Jen (<a href="https://twitter.com/jrho_jrho">@jhro_jhro</a>), and talking some hockey in real life with people I talk to on the Twitters all the time. I love this. If you ever come to Verizon, say the word and we&#8217;ll meet by the Dunkin&#8217; Donuts. (Which no longer has iced tea, so maybe we&#8217;ll meet somewhere else.)</p>

<p>The second shiny object was literally one for the record books. Ovechkin scored career goal number 484, passing Sergei Federov and claiming the <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/alex-ovechkin-breaks-nhl-record-for-most-career-goals-by-a-russian--video-022944691.html">title of most goals by a Russian-born player in NHL history</a>.</p>

<p>To round out the night &#8211; and maybe because he was afraid of Jess taking his job &#8211; Slapshot came down and paid us a visit. The Caps didn&#8217;t win the game, but we definitely had a winner of a night.</p>

<p>Since losing this game to Dallas, the Caps have won 5 straight and jumped over the NYR (<em>whoop!</em>) for first in the Metro Division. Now if only the Penguins could stop losing in OT and get those second points&#8230;.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a understatement to say  the Crosbot is off to a slow start this season. With 3 G and 7 A, his 10 points rank him 134th in the League. This from a guy who finished third in goals last year, and was only beaten on the very last day. The Pens, however, have turned around the struggle bus around and are now 4th in the East (8th in the League) with 24 points.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the most superstitious guy in the <del>locker room</del> <del>League</del> world to do?</p>

<p>I imagine Sid debating &#8220;warm-up helmet&#8221; vs. &#8220;peanut butter-and-something-not-jelly&#8221; at length. Perhaps he called a friend (John Tavares) who used graph paper to plot the pros and cons (John Tavares).  He didn&#8217;t just throw off his helmet in the tunnel and ask Duper to hockey-stick his hair.</p>
<p>Or maybe he did.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/brittamulaney/status/667491594250166272</p>
<p>Either way, it worked. It even works with that mustache (er, in spite of the mustache). And it worked in real life, as Sid scored the game winning goal vs. Colorado. You know what that means.</p>

<p>Here are links if you&#8217;re the type to enjoy a <strong><a href="http://postimg.org/image/mes6ipkoj/full/">HUGE version of Sid&#8217;s photo</a></strong>. Just give up, everyone else. (There appear to be a few pixels missing right under his nose. Clearly a Flyers fan Photoshop hack, yes?)  Here&#8217;s the entire <strong><a href="http://postimg.org/gallery/3cl2890ac/351ccb15/">Penguins headshot gallery</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Also enjoy the <strong><a href="http://tiny.cc/ujr43x">Islanders roster</a></strong>, looking monochromatically dramatic.</p>
<p>These pictures are gigantic. You could make a life-sized cardboard cutout of John Tavares&#8230; and marry it. (I say &#8220;you&#8221; because I am already married. Is it polygamy to marry a photo? What if it just rides shotgun while I drive in the carpool lane?)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Get it? &#8220;If you&#8217;re gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band&#8221;? No? Oh well. Country music problems. Today we have another guest training camp report, this time from Texas and courtesy of <strong>Brenda (<a href="http://twitter.com/wishinonehand">@wishinonehand</a>)</strong>!</p>
<p>The day before Brenda was heading to Texas on vacation, she got a Facebook message from a friend: Henrik Lundqvist was doing a signing at Birchbox in SoHo for the first 150 people who bought either a t-shirt or a pair of boxer briefs from <a href="http://breadandboxers.com/int/"><strong>Bread &amp; Boxers</strong></a> (for whom he&#8217;s a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">spokesmodel</span> spokesman). So of course she ran for the door, down the street and got there 2.5 hours early. To be 6th in line.  She managed some coherent speech and minimal swooning while posing for this:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Brenda, “His shirt was SO SOFT” and she strongly resisted the urge to pet his hair. Because you can’t be in jail <em>and</em> go to Austin for a week of Stars practice! On to Texas, where Brenda stayed with <a href="https://twitter.com/vickyandnikki/"><strong>Vicky</strong></a> (of <a href="https://vickyandnikkis5hole.wordpress.com/"><strong>VickyAndNikkisFiveHole</strong></a>). She reports:</p>
<p>Day 1: Jamie Benn seems to be pretty well recovered from his surgery. Must be that new <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">strength and conditioning coach</span> fitness model he&#8217;s been dating. He was skating quite a bit on a line with Eaves, which is WAY too much hotness for one line.</p>

<p>Between practices they brought in a huge group of little kids on a school field trip, who all got Seguin jerseys and were quizzed them about hockey and the Stars. Seggy took a selfie with them [<a href="https://twitter.com/tseguinofficial/status/644940507685126144">Twitter</a>]. Seguin &amp; Sharp also spent a bunch of time on a line together. If we thought that the combo of Benn &amp; Eaves was as good as it could get, Sharpie &amp; Seggy certainly gave them a run for their money.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later in the day, Jordie Benn’s beard showed off its post-season form. And I&#8217;m just going to say right now that the moment that <strong><a href="https://instagram.com/s_johns28/">Stephen</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/stjohns28">Johns</a></strong> makes it to the NHL, he&#8217;ll need a Foxy Friday IMMEDIATELY. (Pants, he has a ginger beard!).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later that night the Stars had an outdoor fan fest, which included a bouncy house (for kids only – <em>boo</em>) and a TERRIBLE cover band who wore different colored Adidas track. [Pants note: That sounds kind of awesome.] There were Q&amp;A sessions and I was able to get autographs from all of the players who were there. I also got to meet the lovely <a href="https://twitter.com/Classlicity"><strong>Carolyn</strong></a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/merrinish"><strong>Merrin</strong></a> from <a href="https://twobeardedladies.wordpress.com/"><strong>Two Bearded Ladies</strong></a>. I felt an immediate bond with Carolyn upon learning of our shared deep and abiding love of Brandon Bollig. Of course I also managed to find a fellow NY Ranger fan and had to introduce myself to him. #BlueshirtsUnited [Pants note: Hashtags you’ll never again see on this blog.]</p>
<p>Day 2: <a href="https://twitter.com/vickydombroski"><strong>Vicky</strong></a> &amp; I were running late, and spied Jordie Benn, Jason Demers, Kari Lehtonen &amp; 2 other players trying to get back into the arena after apparently running to the nearby gas station for snacks. [Pants note: They need an Intern Jeff Skinner!] Eventually someone did let them in. Incredibly, not even three minutes later, Demers was already on the ice. How did he get dressed so quickly???</p>
<p>On Day 2, the Stars decided to unveil their strategy for the upcoming season: blind the rest of the league with their beauty. For a large portion of the practice, Benn, Seguin, Sharp, Demers &amp; Oduya skated together as a 5-man unit. Jesus, Dallas, are you trying to KILL us??? I&#8217;m shocked that the ice did not melt (full disclosure: we melted – A LOT). A bunch of other stuff happened at practice, too, but honestly, who cares?</p>

<p>Day 3: Today was the &#8220;official&#8221; scrimmage that you had to pay to attend, as well as the only day concession stands were open, so of course I took advantage and had a frozen strawberry margarita. We were excited that they were handing out rally towels to fans, until we discovered that they were left over from Mike Modano&#8217;s retirement night from 2014. Very lame, Stars! Vicky &amp; I were joined by Le&#8217;Loni, Micah &amp; Laura, her fellow Texas Stars Ice Patrol friends, and Nikki, the other half of <a href="https://vickyandnikkis5hole.wordpress.com/"><strong>VickyAndNikkisFiveHole</strong></a>. We were NOTHING but trouble. A lot of people were SUPER PISSED that Jamie Benn &amp; Ales Hemsky didn&#8217;t skate in the scrimmage. Still, it was really fun. Seggy looked great, scoring 2 goals but missing on a penalty shot.</p>

<p>The funniest part of the day was that <a href="https://twitter.com/merrinish"><strong>Merrin</strong></a> was able to get Jamie to sign the notebook (available at the <a href="https://twobeardedladies.wordpress.com/"><strong>Two Bearded Ladies</strong></a> online <a href="http://www.redbubble.com/people/twobl?SSAID=314743&amp;utm_source=shareasale&amp;utm_medium=affiliates&amp;utm_campaign=banner"><strong>shop</strong></a>) that has a picture of a sloth in a hockey helmet hanging from a hockey stick along with a quote from Jamie&#8217;s scouting report: &#8220;We&#8217;re not sure if he&#8217;s really that slow, or if he just refuses to move.&#8221; Well done, ma&#8217;am.</p>

<p>Day 4: The best part of the ENTIRE camp was that after the scrimmage (and after the laps that both squads had to skate), Sharp and Oduya were out on the ice. We thought maybe they were going to do some drills with the coaches, but then Oduya skated off. Sharp skated a bit with the puck and then shot it right at the boards below us (we were sitting right on the glass). We laughed and waved at him. He skated by and then turned around and smiled at us and flipped the puck over the glass to me. Another woman who was sitting at the other end of the row went to get it (it had gone behind me), but there was ZERO CHANCE I was letting anyone get the puck that Sharpie had clearly wanted ME to have. Shockingly, in my entire life (we don&#8217;t need to talk about exactly how many years that is), this is the first time I&#8217;ve ever had a player give me a puck. A 3-time Stanley Cup champion is a pretty outstanding place to start, don&#8217;t you think?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Day 5: After the last practice, Sharpie was talking to some of the fans on his way off the ice and I was able to get him to sign the puck he&#8217;d given me the day before (side bar: his hands are <em>very soft</em>). YESSSS!!! So in the space of 8 days, I met 2 of the 3 best looking men in the NHL (Patrice Bergeron being the third – although I met him at the NHL store this past season), which is pretty ridiculous. I am feeling very blessed. Thank you, hockey gods!</p>

<p>Thankfully pre-season hockey is here and regular season hockey is right around the corner. <strong>Let&#8217;s go Rangers!</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Oh my God, a blog post.</strong></p>
<p>I know. We have been everywhere except in front of our computers lately, or honestly in front of TVs watching hockey. Who vacations in the spring? Fools! I looked at my calendar and all of a sudden:</p>
<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s almost April.</li>
<li>The Penguins have 9 games left.</li>
</ol>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-22130 aligncenter" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/britney-laughing.gif" alt="britney-laughing" width="500" height="281" /></p>
<p><strong>I AM ALARMED.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s my own fault, except for the part that is the Penguins&#8217; fault for losing 5 of 6 including one OT game. In March. I would have felt implosive rage except I was on the beach reading <em>Eat, Pray, Love</em> for the third time, so I trust you guys felt my share. Now, it&#8217;s time to&#8230;</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-22131 aligncenter" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/panic.gif" alt="panic" width="389" height="157" /></p>
<p>Looking at the standings makes me want to barf. Trying to figure out who&#8217;s got in-conference games, games in hand, four-point games&#8230; someone hold my hair. I know it&#8217;s a selfish panic, because at least the Pens are currently in playoff standing. It could be worse.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-22132 aligncenter" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/standings.png" alt="standings" width="386" height="115" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/standings.png 386w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/standings-300x89.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px" /></p>
<p>I love Chuck, but man, I hate the Bruins so much and it&#8217;s every woman for herself down the stretch. I&#8217;m jumping over dead bodies like I need to beat a zombie to Terminus.</p>
<p>Note: The Bruins are not dead, but who the &amp;$#@ thought Ottawa would win seven in a row? Sometimes, you just want to:</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-22133 aligncenter" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/arya2.gif" alt="arya2" width="500" height="266" /></p>
<p>Anyway, I have my own problems, and they look like TWO MORE GAMES VS. THE FLYERS. That is high drama and TV ratings gold, but holy hell. My head might spin clean around. I can&#8217;t even comprehend the Rangers being first in the Metro &#8211; and by eight points! Islanders, you had one job!</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-22134 aligncenter" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/points.png" alt="points" width="464" height="325" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/points.png 464w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/points-300x210.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" /></p>
<p>That is not the job I&#8217;m talking about! GAH.</p>
<p>So here we go, down the stretch, with claws out and no mercy. Please let the Penguins pass the Isles, the Caps make the playoffs, the Rangers lose every remaining game, Crosby win the scoring race and Tavares need a hug afterward.</p>
<p>You guys with us?</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-22135 aligncenter" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/amy.gif" alt="amy" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<p>Jeez, is anyone else hungry? I could stress-eat two who pizzas right now.</p>

Celina talks so fast that I am out of breath before they even get to Crosby, but this is something you&#8217;d (er, I would) probably pay a fortune to attend.  There is far less chance of physical embarrassment dealing cards than carrying plates, and I can&#8217;t help thinking Beau Bennett is a lot safer in this low-impact environment.</p>

<p>This is a guy who scored his first NHL goal on his first NHL shot during his first NHL shift in his first NHL game. Remember when he got so mad at the All-Star Skills Competition because he didn&#8217;t hear the cue to start? This look on his face is TrueToews, the one he keeps locked away since Captain Serious changed his costume. There is also a puppy, in case any of me survived.</p>

<p>This comes hot on the tail of Tazer&#8217;s vitally important in-arena message: don&#8217;t get up to pee during the game. HOLD IT, PEOPLE!

<p>PensTV has a <a href="http://penguins.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=752588&amp;navid=DL|PIT|home">video feature from the event</a>. Everyone is always having so much fun, from the players to the kids.

<p>For most, even professional athletes, bowling is a great equalizer where success comes accidentally but often enough that you feel you might just actually get the hang of this someday. If not, there&#8217;s usually a crane game and maybe even karaoke.</p>

<p>Coach Johnston (who I think of as &#8220;Coach J,&#8221; as if he&#8217;s my own coach) seems like a kindly high school principal, guiding his charges into adulthood with calm and poise. I have the urge to ask him what to do with my future, so he can explain it in a way that makes me realize I knew all along.</p>
