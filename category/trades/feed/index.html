				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>After his abrupt and somewhat surprising departure from Boston this summer, tonight marks Tyler Seguin&#8217;s return to Boston.  It&#8217;s been four months since the fireworks of the July 4th trade that sent Seguin to Dallas Stars.  The pain of that day still stings at times, but like any resilient New Englander, I just have to pick myself up off the floor, drink my iced coffee, and move on with my life.</div>

<div>I can&#8217;t lie &#8211; it hasn&#8217;t been easy.  The fangirl in me <strong><em>dies</em> </strong>a little bit every time I see him in that Stars&#8217; sweater.  It just doesn&#8217;t feel right or real to me.  Green is SO not his color.  He looks MUCH better in black and gold.</div>

<div>But the hockey fan/blogger in me understands full well why things happened the way that they did.  In an ideal world, every player I loved would stay with their teams forever, win multiple Stanley Cups &amp; all the trophies, and it would be all rainbows and puppies and adorable babies.</div>

<div>I pride myself of understanding a lot about the sport and about how things work from a management perspective, so I try to be as objective as I can in situations like this.  I can&#8217;t take it personally.  I don&#8217;t have to like it, but I have to accept it.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Boston&#8217;s depth, while a tremendous asset, stifled Seguin.  When you&#8217;re playing behind Krecji and Bergeron, it ain&#8217;t exactly easy to distinguish yourself.  Seguin was a boy amongst men and he wasn&#8217;t doing enough to make himself irreplaceable.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In Dallas, Seguin has the opportunity to be the BMOC, and let&#8217;s face it, we all know that he&#8217;ll relish it like a hot dog.  He is playing on the top line with all-star Jamie Benn, while in Boston he was relegated to the 3rd line.</div>

	</div>
<div>I hope that the trade served as a bit of a wake-up call for Seguin. While we can&#8217;t really blame him for the partying and the hijinks he got himself into &#8211; I mean the guy is 19 years old, rich, Stanley Cup Champ, hot like fire in a city filled with college girls &#8211; the maturity just wasn&#8217;t high on the list of priority  For a team that needs to win and win NOW, the Bruins just didn&#8217;t have time to wait for him to grow up.</div>

<div>Chara ain&#8217;t getting any younger and with their 2011 Stanley Cup win and their Finals appearance last year, this Bruins team needs to strike while the iron is hot.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In Seguin, they had a talented player not quite living up to his potential but with an exceptionally high value for a team looking for a young center.  What Bruins were desperately lacking was a strong winger to complement their top line centers.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Enter Dallas Stars and Loui Eriksson.  Some phone calls were made. A deal was reached and it was so long Seguin and hello Loui.</div>

	</div>
<div>The season is still young so who knows what the ending will be to this hockey tale.  Seguin has 15 points so far with the Stars.  Eriksson has only 3.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The season is long and I&#8217;m not worried.  I think that each team is going to get exactly what they needed.</div>

<p>If you weren&#8217;t crying, you were the Devils.  No &#8211; they were crying too.</p>

<p>This kind of thing doesn&#8217;t just happen.  Lately more and more players are moving teams in hopes of a final dash to the little table and a reason to shake Bettman&#8217;s hand like they mean it.  2013-14 will be no different.  Here&#8217;s a look at some veteran guys trying to get their grooves back.</p>
<p><strong>Jarome Iginla &#8211; Boston Bruins</strong></p>
<p>Dust yourself off and try again.  After the trade deadline excitement that sent Iginla to the <del>Bruins</del> Penguins this season, he has landed on the Boston roster.  I would have loved to see him get a full season with Crosby, but the Penguins have $5 to spend and Iginla, at 36, is not a bargain bin guy.</p>

			</span>
		</span>
	<em>Really this time.</em></p>
<p>He&#8217;ll find a good fit with the Bs, whose team has changed quite a bit from what Iginla would&#8217;ve joined in March.  The deal is 1 year/$6 million (base salary plus incentives [<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/story/2013/07/05/sp-nhl-jarome-iginla-boston-bruins-free-agency.html">link</a>]) &#8211; a short term, high price, &#8216;show me what you&#8217;re working with&#8217; contract.  Smart move by the Bruins, good choice by Iggy.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Alfredsson &#8211; Red Wings</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re old and want to win before you die, consider the Red Wings!  That should be their slogan.  After 17-years in Ottawa, Daniel Alfredsson peaced out in one big cloud of proverbial dust.</p>

	<em>Seems legit.</em></p>
<p>Read the very funny <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/why-daniel-alfredsson-heel-turn-could-good-thing-203248765.html">Puck Daddy</a> take on his departure (Harrison blows the cover on my lobster metaphor for good measure).  Alfie got 1 year/$5.5 million, a lot like Iginla, except he&#8217;s already 40.  He basically told the Wings to meet him at the dealership with the keys to a Camaro and no jokes about a mid-life crisis.  Will it work?  Both teams finished 7th in their divisions last year with 56 points.  If we were betting our last, fixed-income retirement dollar, we&#8217;d go with the Red Wings too.</p>
<p><strong>Danny Briere &#8211; Montreal</strong></p>
<p>I just threw up in my mouth a little.  Apparently fifteen teams were interested in Briere&#8230; and he chose the Habs.  Ugh, Danny, WHY!?!  I speak French!  I can estimate distances in metric!  (No, I can&#8217;t.)  Why don&#8217;t the Capitals care about me and bring me polite, elfin forwards once in a damned while?!  All they did was big fat nothing and I&#8217;m stuck here with Mike Green&#8217;s hand tattoos and Nicklas Backstrom&#8217;s babydaddy rumors.  It&#8217;s not like we don&#8217;t go to overtime!  GAH.</p>

	<em>Old picture. Nice arms.</em></p>
<p>I admire the gutsiness of Danny&#8217;s choice.  He didn&#8217;t want to leave Philly, and he could&#8217;ve gone to the Islanders &#8211; they are $23 million <strong>UNDER</strong> the cap [<a href="http://capgeek.com/islanders/">CapGeek.com</a>] and after the DiPietro debacle, they&#8217;d hardly be fazed if a washed-up old guy fails to hit the 20 goal mark.  Instead, Montreal is an impossibly tough media market.  A veteran player coming off an underperforming season and a compliance buyout could be made to suffer &#8211; and already has.  Google it, you&#8217;ll see a lot of Montreal fans are more sick about this than I am.  Danny signed for 2-years, $4 mill/year.</p>

	</p>
<p>Now that Danny is a Hab and I&#8217;ll have to follow them a bit, here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.habseyesontheprize.com/2013/7/8/4505682/is-the-daniel-briere-signing-as-horrible-as-we-thought">one Canadiens blogger</a> rationally considering Danny&#8217;s career, potential and role on the new team.  He writes himself into being almost excited to have Briere on board.  That&#8217;s good enough for me.  As is this hilarious <a href="http://bobgaineysstare.wordpress.com/2013/07/05/late-but-never-might-have-been-better-briere-signs-with-mtl/">blog post</a>, complete with LOTR reference.</p>
<p><strong>Milan Hejduk &#8211; Not the Avalanche</strong></p>
<p>For a second there, it was going to be &#8220;old folks dance at the family reunion&#8221; with Hejduk and Tanguay in Colorado.  Sadly, only I want that and just for Throwback Thursday&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-17058" alt="forsale" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hejduk.jpg" width="480" height="319" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hejduk.jpg 600w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hejduk-300x199.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hejduk-500x332.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></p>
<p>Word is the Avs will not resign the UFA, who has been with the organization since 1998.  Last season, the Avs gave him a 1-year, $2 million deal.  He won&#8217;t get that again.  At 37, his agent says the best look will be a contract with incentives for putting up points (these count against the cap).  That sounds reasonable to me.  With teams giving $4 million-plus, single year deals without guarantees, I imagine Hejduk will find a place that has room under their cap to spend next season.</p>
<p><strong>Jaromir Jagr &#8211; Who wants him?</strong></p>
<p>One of many changes so far this off-season, the Bruins will not renew their lease on Jagr.  He made $4.55 million on last year&#8217;s contract with Dallas/Boston.  His agent says several teams are interested in signing the 41-year old [<a href="http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=677049&amp;navid=nhl:topheads">link</a>].  Any guesses?  He&#8217;s still got it &#8211;  9 P in 11 reg season games, 10 A in 22 playoff games &#8211; but not to the tune of $4+ million.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday was America&#8217;s birthday.  There were barbecues, patriotic music, fireworks, waving flags&#8230;and one very big trade.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Bruins decided to have their own pyrotechnic display when they traded former 1st round draft pick Tyler Seguin, Rich Peverley, and prospect Ryan Button to the Dallas Stars for Loui Eriksson and three prospects &#8211; Joe Morrow, Reilly Smith, and Matt Fraser.</p>

<p>Yea, girl.  That&#8217;s exactly what I said.</p>
<p>At first, I was confused and perplexed.  Did the Bruins really just give up their #2 draft pick and ship him off to the Lone Star State?</p>

<p>During the recent NHL Draft, I had a feeling that something might be brewing.  After Bruins&#8217; GM Peter Chiarelli called him out,  you could tell that the organization wasn&#8217;t feeling Seguin and his utterly disappointing post-season performance.</p>
<p>Chiarelli called into question Seguin&#8217;s professionalism and work ethic &#8211; but what he was essentially saying is Tyler Seguin needed to stop being Tyler Seguin and start being more like Patrice Bergeron.</p>
<p>But no way did I <em>actually</em> think that the Bruins would trade away one of their most popular players so quickly.  I thought for sure that they give him a year to get his ish together, grow up a bit, and then go from there.</p>

	<i>okay&#8230;so maybe I take that back&#8230;</i></p>
<p>After the initial shock wore off and the eyebrow crinkling ceased, I took to the interwebs to obtain the knowledge I needed to fully understand why something like this might happen.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;ve concluded is simple &#8211; <strong>it&#8217;s all about the benjamins.</strong></p>

<p>Seguin is set to begin a six-year, $34.5 million contract next season.   Peverley is in the midst of a contract that carries an average annual value of $3.25 million through the end of the 2014-15 season.   Eriksson&#8217;s contract runs through end of 2015-16 season and has an average annual value of $4.25 million.</p>
<p>You know that WUYS don&#8217;t do no math but basically what I&#8217;ve been able to deduce using my fingers, toes, and abacus, is that the Bruins will save around $4 million in cap space.  With the salary cap decreasing next season, the Bruins needed to reduce salary to re-sign Tuukka and Bergeron, which let&#8217;s face it are a more integral part of the team&#8217;s success than Seguin.  Bruins also are in need of a winger with the departure of Horton and Jagr.  With this trade, they now have about $9 million to work with.</p>

<p>Even with addition of the 27 year-old Eriksson, the Bruins are still way light at wing.  I&#8217;d bet good money  they use some of that $9 mil surplus to sign a winger off of the free agent market.  Just a few names up for grabs &#8211; Ignila, Clarkson, Ryder, Clowe, Cleary.  It will just be a matter of finding the best fit, both financially and organizationally.  To play on this team, you have to be a certain kind of player.</p>
<p>Now while I understand why something like this happened, it doesn&#8217;t mean that particularly thrilled about it.  I feel like it is the Joe Thornton Conundrum all over again.</p>

<p>I like Seguin and I think he&#8217;s enormously talented, if a bit undisciplined.  Maturity takes time to develop.  Not all players are Bergeron and Landeskog who come into the league already acting like they&#8217;re 30.  I kind of have this feeling that Bruins are abandoning Seguin at a time when all he really might need is a swift kick in the ass and a dressing down by Cam Neely. Then maybe he&#8217;s wake up and pull it together.</p>
<p>On the other hand, maybe they have given Seguin that dressing down. Maybe they have given him that chance and still nothing changed.  As fans, we may never know the truth.</p>
<p>So for now, I wish Seguin the best of luck in Dallas and look forward to the first instagram photo of him wearing a cowboy hat.</p>

<p>However, as you know, my traitorous heart does love Danny Briere.  <strong>It&#8217;s beyond reason.</strong>  Out since suffering a concussion in practice on March 23, Danny was back on the ice with the team yesterday.  He could play as soon as Saturday vs. Buffalo.

	</a><em>Stop it, stop being perfect.</em></p>
<p>Now, why do I even mention this?</p>
<p><strong>1) Concussions can go to hell.  </strong>For any player on any team&#8230; just the word turns my stomach.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/2013/04/09/the-no-trade-claude/danny4/" rel="attachment wp-att-15803"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-15803" alt="danny4" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/danny4.jpg" width="504" height="326" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/danny4.jpg 630w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/danny4-300x193.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/danny4-500x323.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px" /></a></p>
<p>2) I have a not-so-secret wish for the <strong>Flyers to make the playoffs</strong> and face Pittsburgh in the first round.  I shouldn&#8217;t play with fire, but I&#8217;d love see the Pens redeem themselves for last year&#8217;s debacle.</p>

<p><strong>3) Will Danny get traded</strong> <del>to somewhere I can love him openly</del>?</p>
<p>MOST IMPORTANT.  There has been a lot of talk about Briere&#8217;s future with the Flyers.  His contract is $6.5 million with two years left (<strong>Update: WRONG.</strong> Read comment below from KC!).  Last season, Danny was way off his goal-scoring pace, despite personally terrorizing me during the playoffs.  (Seriously &#8211; Briere got 16 G in 70 games all year, then 8 G in 11 games during the playoffs.)  He&#8217;s also 35, which is NOT old because we are NOT old but we&#8217;re almost that old.  In a few years.</p>

<p>Rumors flew that multiple teams were interested in acquiring Briere before the trade deadline, but Danny said publicly he would not waive his No Trade <del>Claude</del> Clause (<strong>UPDATE:</strong> It&#8217;s a No Movement Claude, which means no AHL either. Thanks Jess.).  The man loves Jersey, okay?  His adorakids go to school there, Gingeroux is there, it&#8217;s precious.  There was speculation the Flyers might try to push him [<a href="http://eveningthescore.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/there-will-be-trades/">link</a>].   If there were ever a viable window to acquire value in exchange for Briere&#8230; it passed when he got hurt.</p>
<p>He traded one problem for another.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/2013/04/09/the-no-trade-claude/danny2/" rel="attachment wp-att-15805"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-15805" alt="danny2" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/danny2.jpg" width="473" height="356" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/danny2.jpg 526w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/danny2-300x225.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/danny2-500x375.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Now the best/worst solution is for Danny to come back and play well.</strong>  He could still help the Flyers make the playoffs.  At the same time, it may prove his viability to other teams.  The better he looks, the more they&#8217;ll offer and the harder Philly might lean on him to accept.  Late career trades and waived NTCs are the new dance crazes, don&#8217;t you know?</p>
<p>There is also the new CBA&#8217;s Amnesty Clause, which the Flyers could use to buy out Danny&#8217;s contract this summer.  He&#8217;d still get $6.5 mil/year, but the Flyers would free up that amount under their salary cap. [<a href="http://eveningthescore.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/there-will-be-trades/">link</a>, <a href="http://www.thereporteronline.com/article/20130403/SPORTS03/130409766/parent-trade-deadline-moves-show-flyers-looking-for-salary-cap-room">link</a>]  They&#8217; d rather have something to show that money, but at least the Amnesty Clause would let them spend it twice.</p>

	</a></em><em>I don&#8217;t know what to feel.</em></p>
<p><strong>Does anyone know:</strong> If the Flyers buy out Briere under the Amnesty Clause, does he become a UFA (like with a regular buyout)?  Could he get $6.5 mill/year AND play somewhere else?  If that&#8217;s true, I wouldn&#8217;t waive my NTC either. I&#8217;d make the Flyers play me or pay me, because I know I can get paid to play somewhere else when it&#8217;s over.</p>
<p>(Best we can figure, he&#8217;d get 2/3 of $5 million.  See below.)</p>

	<em>That&#8217;s crazy.</em></p>
<p>Now we&#8217;re past the trade deadline, and Danny is still a Flyer.  If he storms the playoffs again, maybe he convinces the Flyers not to use the Amnesty Clause.  He could scrape into next season and get another crack at&#8230; what?  Being worth $6.5 million?  It seems unlikely.  The Flyers need that money and they need it this summer, when teams are more willing to negotiate.</p>

<p>Of course, this Flyers&#8217; summer might be only 10 games away.  Philly fans have had a rough year &#8211; we know a few, and like them anyway.  Lord knows we&#8217;ve all been there.  So here&#8217;s Captain Claude saying nice things about them in perhaps the most orange environment even caught on film.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>MEMO FROM CHUCK’S DESK</b></p>
<p>Oh what fresh HELL is this! The last 12 hours have been a roller coaster of emotions. First, the drama of the Bruins/Candiens game. Never ceases to amaze me how these games can take me to the height of joy down to the bitter pit of despair so many time in a mere 60 minutes. At the disappointing end of last night’s game, I went to bed all wretched but optimistic that today would bring some glimmer of hope&#8230;namely in the form of <strong>Jarome Iginla</strong>.</p>

<p>Ray Shero is also a cruel thief and magical wizard. I don&#8217;t know how he does his voodoo magic to make these great deals without sacrificing a <i>single</i> roster player. It is just not right. It is downright Faustian.</p>

<p>Interweb speculations says that Iginla changed his mind after seeing the Bruins lose to the Habs last night but I <b>highly</b> doubt that his decision was solely based on the outcome of a single game. I’m betting that the Bruins and Pens were his top choices and after careful consideration, he went with the team that he felt was the better fit for him.</p>

<p>Although it pains me admit, right now the Pens do look like the better team, but I worry about their defense and goaltending.  Letang on the IR and Fleury injured are never good things.  Can new acquisition Murray and backup Tomas Vokoun fill the void? Debatable….</p>
<p>I truly believe that Iginla would have been a better fit for the Bruins and their style of play.  He could have provided that goal-scoring, finishing ability that the Bruins need and the Pens definitely do not.  They are front loaded with fire power. Can’t someone throw a little something our way?</p>

<p>Our twitter feed is going to be insufferable today – all the Pens fans that Pants added squeeing and fangirling all over the place and everyone else pissed that they didn’t get Ignila or annoyed with all of those Pens fans.</p>

<p>With a little over a dozen games left in the season, it will be interesting to see what happens in the Eastern Conference.  But remember, the regular season is one thing…it’s all about the playoffs.</p>
<p><b>MEMO FROM PANTS&#8217; CUPBOARD UNDER THE STAIRS</b></p>
<p>Wow.  It’s only 10 AM and I (as part of the Pens fanbase) have been called a lot of names, via every social media platform available.  As I’m clearly obnoxious, insufferable, gloating, cocky, a fangirl and an ignorant jinx who only exists to ruin other hockey fans dreams&#8217; all while prematurely hoisting the Cup, there isn&#8217;t much to say except that I&#8217;m happy for my team.</p>

<p>The Pens were a hard nine yesterday and today they’re a 10+.  But hot or not, they’ve still gotta keep winning.  If anyone learned anything: it’s not over till it’s over.  That goes for trades and it goes for seasons.  (Oh, maybe they also learned not to report news until it&#8217;s actually fact.)</p>

<p>Shero had a hand, he played it.  Iggy had a choice, he made it.  I hope it pays off for both, and the Pens, and for me.</p>

<p>EStaal was minus-257 (ish) on the season.  Intern Jeff Skinner had a concussion and was limited to 20 goals.  Cam Ward&#8217;s save percentage was 36th among goalies (down from 17th the year before).  They picked up a little after getting a new coach in Kirk Muller, but still finished 23rd overall.</p>
<p>So you know what this summer is about.</p>

<p>Does Eric Staal look like a captain who messes around?  Or does he scrape a bad season off the windshield like a bug and intend to do something about it?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Action shot of Eric preparing to wipe the ice with someone and not laugh.</em></p>
<p>Eric (and management, though I prefer to think just of Eric) thought about how the Canes could get better: like more goals (ranked 16th overall) and a better power play (20th overall).  Then they looked around the NHL.</p>

<p>You all heard me wailing when Jordan turned down 10 years with Pittsburgh.  He got traded to Carolina during his wedding reception (Ray Shero does not do the Electric Slide), and promptly signed an almost identical deal with Carolina.  It&#8217;s a great move from JStaal even if I get a little dramatic talking about it.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">With Jordan on board, Eric turned the bus toward Washington, DC.  Or the outskirts, since that&#8217;s probably how far Alex Semin walked in the time the Caps did not re-sign him.  He started this walk in November, which explains a lot about how he played this season.  (Sorry I&#8217;m not sorry).</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">But (but, but, but), Alex Semin is an awesome natural talent.  It think Carolina is a great fit for him because 1) no Ovi and 2) no Ovi.  I&#8217;m not crazy about AO GR8 either, but he and Sasha were poison for each other.  Ovi gets lazy.  This time last year we thought he might put Jennifer Hudson out of a job as Weight Watchers spokesperson.  He helped run Boudreau out of town.  All the while Semin hid behind him like a bratty little brother.  When he did something good, #sashacares would trend on Twitter.  Sarcastic, yes.  Also true.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Semin needs to be on his own.  Cut him loose, see if he can fly.  He has the ability to make $7 million/year look like a good deal.  Does he have the chutzpah?  If anyone can make him prove it, I think EStaal is the man for the job.  Eric has three little brothers + two kids + Skinner and does not put up with this crap.</p>

<p>What will this season bring for the Canes?  Coach Muller intends to test drive the Staal/Staal line in training camp [<a href="http://prohockeytalk.nbcsports.com/2012/06/27/canes-coach-says-staal-brothers-will-begin-on-same-line/">link</a>], likely with Eric on the wing.  If they go Staal-Staal-Skinner, I swear that I will have the adorable-ocalypse meltdown.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/2012/08/03/oh-carolina/kristen-bell-meme-hug-sloth/" rel="attachment wp-att-11711"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-11711" title="Kristen-Bell-Meme-hug-sloth" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Kristen-Bell-Meme-hug-sloth-500x333.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="266" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Kristen-Bell-Meme-hug-sloth-500x333.jpg 500w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Kristen-Bell-Meme-hug-sloth-300x200.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Kristen-Bell-Meme-hug-sloth.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>Or they could roll two deep in front, with back-to-back Staal-centered lines and Semin alongside.    The Canes lost Brandon Sutter in the trade to Pittsburgh, who is &#8220;arguably the Canes&#8217; best defensive forward&#8221; [<a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/06/23/2154214/canes-get-jordan-staal-in-trade.html">link</a>].  Well JStaal&#8217;s got that in spades, having been nominated in &#8217;11 for the Selke Trophy.</p>
<p>More offense, more defense.  Things are looking sweet in Carolina.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>(Red Sox fan.  I had to.)</em></p>
<p>I like the Hurricanes for no reasons other than my soft spot for expansion teams and my combined love for EStaal, Ward &amp; Intern Jeff Skinner.  Maybe I always knew they&#8217;d get Jordan.  Maybe I just want a road trip to worship at the Shrine of Staal, as suggested by <a href="http://twitter.com/thekitchenette">@thekitchenette</a>.  Either way I hope the Canes do well this year.  Just not as well as the Caps.  Or the Lightning.</p>
<p>So really not that well at all.</p>
<p>ACK.  My Southeast Conference &#8220;Kill-F***-Marry&#8221; is getting crowded.  If the NHL realigns [<a href="http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=604852">link</a>], I trade the Bolts for the Pens and things are even worse.  Basically I&#8217;d root for Carolina to finish 3rd in whatever their conference might be.  Realignment would require them to top the Flyers and Rangers for that to happen, landing behind Pittburgh and Washington in my ultimate fantasy reality.  No problem, right?</p>

<p>Cheer up, Mikey!  There&#8217;s always Nicky.  And the 1/4th of a boob not cropped from this photo (not my work).  All is not lost!  Of course the absence of Semin making lazy and ridiculous mistakes means even more people looking at you&#8230; um, nevermind.  Love the glasses.</p>

<p>Holy cow, people.  First off, the Preds went to arbitration last season because they didn&#8217;t want to pay Weber $7+ million for 3 years.  Too bad, he was awarded $7.5 million for 2011-12.  This $110/million deal averages to $7.86 million a year.  Weber will be 27 when the season starts and before he turns 33, over 72% of the contract will have been paid out.  Astronomical numbers, but the average and the front-loading sound like pretty good deals.  In 7-10 years from now, $6 million/year will probably be peanuts compared to what the kids are getting paid.  After that $13 million/year bonus disappears in 4 years, Weber becomes even more attractive trade bait.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>More attractive than this?</em></p>
<p> My head hurts.</p>
<p>Bonuses count against the salary cap.  The Preds have room under their cap for a deal like this.  Here&#8217;s the best part: it&#8217;s front-loaded to discourage the Predators from signing because&#8230; Weber will earn $27 million in the first *calendar* year of this deal.  WTF, how is that possible? [<a href="http://www.broadstreethockey.com/2012/7/19/3169213/shea-weber-contract-offer-sheet-flyers-predators">link</a>]  Here&#8217;s how:</p>

<p>If they match, the Preds would have him for 14 years.  But does Weber want to stay in NSH?  Arbitration last summer, would have been UFA next summer, and now this.  Is Shea sick of waiting for a deal, or trying to jump ship?</p>

<p>And if the Preds match, they have to keep Weber for one season before trying to trade.  That one season will cost them $27 million.  Unhappy player vs a shit-ton of money?  I&#8217;d give anything to know what Weber&#8217;s feeling on Nashville really is.</p>

<p>The really important part of this conversation is: <strong>STAY OUT OF THE EASTERN CONFERENCE, SHEA WEBER</strong>.</p>
<p>This is my nightmare.  Shea Weber as a Flyer.  Ice crews trained to squeegee my favorite players&#8217; faces/blood/talent off the glass in arenas up and down the eastern seaboard.  Watching every game through my fingers.  Knowing Sid is out there six games against this guy, instead of one.  Or Nicky B.  Anyone.  Oh God.</p>

<p>The trade was tempered by news on Wednesday that Jordan turned down a 10-year, $60 million deal with the Penguins.  He had one year left on his contract, and without a long-term lockup it appeared he was packing his bags.</p>
<p>Still when Shero announced the trade at the draft, I had one of these moments:</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/gGV4hxhxW8o?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>The move makes sense &#8211; Jordan wants an expanded role and had a career season (25G, 25A) to set himself up.  But with Crosby (hopefully) back full time and the Malkin-Neal chemistry boiling over, Jordan&#8217;s ice time can only go down.  So Carolina becomes Team Staal.</p>
<p>Intern Jeff Skinner knows we&#8217;ll finally visit now, and he thinks we&#8217;re jerks.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">(From from ohaicarolina.tumblr.com)</p>
<p>Losing Jordan seems like a crazy detriment to the Pens grit and heart, but Ray Shero has proven many times that he&#8217;s right and we should shut up and watch. In exchange for Jordan, the Pens got Brandon Sutter, a very well-suited third line center, defensive prospect Brian Dumoulin and the #8 overall pick (used on dman Derrick Pouliot).</p>

<p>The moral of the story is: get invited to the next Penguins wedding.  Fleury, maybe?  Or Letang, now that he&#8217;s going to be a dad?  Maybe if we&#8217;re really lucky, the Penguins will sign someone new just in time for his wedding this summer&#8230;</p>

<p>John Scott was &#8220;shocked&#8221; to be traded to the Rangers, and was in the middle of doing laundry when the call came.  Bonus points for Foxy Fridays Matt Duchene and Gabriel Landeskog, who led the Avalanche love-fest for players both coming and going by Tweeting their teammates hello and goodbye simultaneously.  Brian Rolston goes back to Boston, where he played 4+ seasons.  The winners are anyone leaving the Islanders or Jets, and anyone going to the Canucks.  The abstainer was The Washington Capitals.  The loser?  Rick Nash.  Let&#8217;s discuss.</p>

<p>The<strong> Washington Capitals made zero trades</strong>, surprising a lot of people.  This seems to say that GMGM either 1) thinks the team is fine the way it is or 2) has given up on this season.  In my opinion, it&#8217;s more likely that no one was buying at his prices.  The Caps chemistry is flawed and inconsistent, but it doesn&#8217;t need to be burned to the ground.  GMGM showed continued/expensive faith in stars and fragile pandas (Sasha Fierce, Mike Green).</p>

<p>Misplaced faith?  Ask me in six weeks when the Caps don&#8217;t make the playoffs.  But what they had to sell (Knuble, Hamrlik) really only matches the Rolston/Mottau deal, and that was for prospects.  The Caps need players who can deliver immediately.  To get those guys, GMGM would have had to give up some of the <strong>few things that are actually working</strong> for the Caps.  I don&#8217;t want Laich, Chimera, Perreault or anyone else moving when they seem to be the only hopes left for March and April.</p>

<p>Then there&#8217;s<strong> poor Rick Nash</strong>.   Chuck and I are biased because we love his smiley lumberjack ways.  Also because he&#8217;s incredibly talented and seems like a genuinely nice guy.  But he&#8217;s no fool.  All Nash has to show for 9 seasons with the Blue Jackets is one trip to the playoffs, swept by the Red Wings.  The only place this captain is going is down with his ship &#8211; so he finally wanted off.</p>

<p>Columbus GM Scott Howson <strong>revealed yesterday that Nash asked to be traded</strong> [<a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/news?slug=nc-trade_deadline_rick_nash_jackets_howson_022712">link</a>].  This refuted talk the Jackets were shopping him of their own accord, and came as the clock ticked down on the biggest fish in the trade pond still trying to bite a hook.  But no team would put out enough bait.  Howson defended his astronomical asking price by pointing out he is neither required nor compelled to trade Nash just because he asked nicely.</p>

<p>Now, I&#8217;m mad.  Howson threw Nash under the bus.  <strong>&#8220;Think you&#8217;re miserable now?  See how it feels when I turn the fans against you!&#8221;</strong> (Obviously not a real Howson quote.)  If Rick can&#8217;t get out of Columbus this summer, my heart will break.  He wanted to anchor that team and be the franchise guy that built a winning club.  Columbus has not delivered.  The Jackets are talking about &#8220;rebuilding&#8221; &#8211; rebuilding what?!  You have one Nash-shaped support beam and no house!  You never did.</p>

<p>In truth, <strong>the Jackets can&#8217;t afford to sell Nash</strong> unless they immediately start winning in return.  <strong>Rick&#8217;s price tag is something between a ransom and a bounty.</strong>  He&#8217;s all they have right now, after supposed big moves like Jeff Carter are quickly forgotten.  Columbus ranks 26th overall in NHL attendance, due in part to being so close to other teams (Pittsburgh fans call match-ups in Columbus &#8220;home games.&#8221;).  Nash is putting bodies in seats on nights when no one else can.  Without him&#8230;.</p>

<p><strong>I also feel for the Jackets&#8217; fans</strong>; of course they don&#8217;t want to lose their one bright spot.  These fans, all the more precious for being in an expansion market, have stuck with the team like Nash has.  I hope they understand the position he&#8217;s in.  They can still get solid players in a Nash trade.  Come summer, teams struggling to make the playoffs now will have time to figure out what a fresh start with Nash is worth.  After what will be the Jackets&#8217; 11th rough season in a row, it&#8217;s certainly worth a try.</p>

<p>Avery&#8217;s effectiveness as an annoying bastard is undeniable &#8211; he rattles other teams &#8211; but he draws tons of penalties in the process.  To the equation, teams must add the likelihood Sean will do something off the ice that speaks louder than anything he does on it.  <strong>I just don&#8217;t see the point of Sean Avery.  </strong>I think any number of guys can do what he does (we&#8217;ve got &#8220;your mama&#8221; jokes galore) with a lot less headache.</p>

<p>Mike Duco formerly of the Florida Panthers got traded to Vancouver. If you were him &#8211; you&#8217;d think JACK POT &#8211; right? Going from a basement dwelling team &#8211; well &#8211; before they spent a boat load of cash and made some mad trades &#8211; to an almost Stanley Cup winning team. Not a bad place to be traded too &#8211; right?</p>
<p>Now consider that fact that you may have tweeted some of the following things during the play-offs:</p>

<p>He also posted one that said, &#8220;HA &#8230; solid night Luongo.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s your first day at training camp with all your new friends. What&#8217;s a boy to do? I bet he didn&#8217;t write the book, &#8220;How to Win Friends and Influence People.&#8221; But I would guess he needs a copy of that stat because Luongo wasn&#8217;t too kind to Kesler after the Olympics but he did forgive him. He kind of had too. Kesler is way too hot not too.</p>

<p>Whew! Now THAT is why I love the Caps! And watch out East coast! Because GM GM got it done by trade deadline. Hop Mop in Pittsburgh, Ovi just traded you in for Jason Arnott. SORRY! He&#8217;s much taller. He doesn&#8217;t have the fabulous long hair but he is a better passer and Herr Sturm will give you a run for your money on speed but I might pay to watch the two of you in a backwards skate off! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I still love you though.

<p>Speed has always been Sturm’s calling card, but he is also a strong two-way player (<strong>did someone say TWO WAY</strong>) with a good shot and a high compete level. At the age of 32, he should still have some useful years ahead of him if his wheels haven’t deteriorated too much. Er ist sehr snell! Das ist sehr gut für das Capitals.</p>
<p>He has been out with tendonitis while with the LA Kings which might be a major concern but he seems like a serious competitor. I think he&#8217;s a good gamble for The Caps. A strong player with play off experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; (LA KING) They probably didn’t think anyone was going to pick me up. One of their young prospects got hurt [Friday night] and might be out for the season so they will have to get someone. I don’t care now. I am all about the Capitals and looking forward to joining the team.”</p>
<p>Well, I am ALL ABOUT YOU! Guten Morgen,  GutenTag  und Guten Abend,  meinen Schöenen Mann!</p>

<p>Kovalev played in Pittsburgh from &#8217;98-&#8217;03, between stints with the NY Rangers.  As a Pen he racked up 149 goals and 197 assists in 344 games.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer</em>: <strong>I hate the NY Rangers.</strong> I especially hated them growing up in Upstate NY and I probably said &#8220;1940!&#8221; a hundred thousand times.  It has been many moons, but I have never really recovered.  And I&#8217;ve always disliked Kovalev, even when he was a Penguin.  Now I am prepared to eat my words.  Come on Alex, and show me how wrong I&#8217;ve been for <em>cough&#8230;20&#8230;cough</em> years.</p>

<p>The Pens may be<strong> close to getting Chris Kunitz back</strong> from injury, and  none too soon.  They are still missing forwards Asham, Johnson,  Tangradi, Letestu and Jeffrey.  Defenseman Paul Martin is out, and this  morning they announced <strong>Brooks Orpik has a broken finger </strong>and will miss 4  weeks.  They have a few other injuries too &#8211; no one you&#8217;ve ever heard of.</p>
<p>Chuck, Beth and I are going to Pittsburgh for the March 25 weekend games.  <strong>We may be called in</strong> to demonstrate the skills we&#8217;ve learned by repeatedly watching <em>The Cutting Edge.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In effort to throw the other Sasha some good karma and some love, from WUYS, here is a post just for him. I guess he was on vacation? I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t care. I was thinking about the trade issue and maybe he doesn&#8217;t want to stay in D.C. under the other Sasha&#8217;s shadow which is why he is only signing one year deals. Either way, Sasha Fierce, we will love you whether you stay or go, cue THE CLASH!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The good news? The Washington Caps  beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 1-0 tonight. My masterblaster, the Russian Machine punched another one passed Fleury for the only goal of the night making his stat against the Flower 20 points in 19 games. OUCH-A-RONY!

<p>The bad news you say, the rumor mill is grinding again that GM-GM (GM George McPhee) is looking to trade Sasha Fierce (Semin) again for &#8211; God knows what &#8211; probably NOT A GOALIE. Since word is they feel they have solid goaltending. Say what? This makes me a very sad panda because I love me both Sashas.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_3298" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/nhl_g_semin_2001.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3298 " title="nhl_g_semin_200[1]" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/nhl_g_semin_2001.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">the other sasha ...Sasha Fierce! Oh Snap!</p></div>The last time this rumor surfaced, they traded Tomas Fleischmann instead and got Scott Hannan. While Fleischmann is out for the season it isn&#8217;t like Hannan has been on fire.  At least he is a plus now instead of a minus like his first 6 games. But Hannan has been a total No-goalov and Sasha Fierce has been Hat-trick McHatty. So I guess we get to play the wait and see. I really hope my house is bugged so if you&#8217;re listening GM GM, don&#8217;t trade Sasha Fierce. You have other dead weight to deal with &#8211; it&#8217;s Russian but it&#8217;s not named Sasha.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peter Chiarelli, Cam Neely, and the Bruins made some <strong>big moves</strong> today, ahead of the February 28th deadline.</p>
<p>They <em>FINALLY</em> did the deal to bring puck-moving Maple Leafs defenseman <strong>Tomas Kaberle</strong> to Boston in exchange for Bruins prospect forward <strong>Joe Colborne</strong> and a 1st round draft pick in 2011.  The deal also stipulates that should the Bs make it to the Stanley Cup Finals this year or re-sign Kaberle at the end of this season, they must also hand over a 2nd round draft pick in 2012.</p>
<div style="width: 522px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://theleafsnation.com/uploads/Image/tln%20tomas%20kaberle,%2015%20february%202011.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="363" /><p class="wp-caption-text">He&#039;s so excited!</p></div>
<p>Kaberle is in his 12th NHL season and has 3 goals, 35 assists, and 16 penalty minutes.  He&#8217;s decently sized (6&#8217;1&#8243;, 214lbs) but he is <strong>exactly </strong>what the Bruins have been lacking on their power play since Dennis Wideman left.  Kaberle can move the puck and work the point.  Since the trade rumors started maybe a a week or couple of weeks ago, I&#8217;m been praying to sweet little baby Jesus in his tuxedo t-shirt that the Bs would make this move.  Kaberle will be with the team tonight (Friday) in Ottawa and will wear #12.  (His #15 was not available as it was Milt Schmidt&#8217;s number which is retired and hanging in the Garden rafters.)</p>

<p>In his presser this afternoon, Chiarelli did mention that it was very hard for them to let go of top prospect Colborne.  Although he has yet to make his NHL debut, Colborne was a player that the team was very high on.  He&#8217;s a <strong>beast</strong> &#8211; 6&#8217;5&#8243;, 213 lbs &#8211; and was their first round pick in 2008.  Chiarelli mentioned that he and other front office personnel called Colborne personally to tell him.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/300h.jpg?w=235" alt="" width="235" height="300" /></p>
<p>Bruins also picked speedy centerman <strong>Rich Peverley</strong> and defenseman <strong>Boris Valabik</strong> from the <strong>Atlanta Thrashers</strong> in exchange for defenseman <strong>Mark Stuart </strong>and forward <strong>Blake &#8220;Wheels&#8221; Wheeler</strong>.  Peverley gives the Bs added speed and crazy faceoff winning skills (55.5% of faceoffs won).  He has 14 goals and 20 assists this season and will join the team on the 20th.  Valabik will go down to Providence to join the Bruins&#8217; minor league affiliate.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.hockeybarn.com/images_content/lib/200911/W1AQZs" alt="" width="306" height="172" /></p>
<p>While I am a little bummed that &#8220;Wheels&#8221; is gone (because I liked him as a player), I&#8217;m very happy and optimistic that the Bruins have made some positive changes to their line up.  With the addition of <strong>Chris Kelly</strong> from Ottawa earlier this week, the Bs look to have put together a strong team with which to make their playoff run.  Add into the mix 4 solid lines that can score and the best goaltending duo in the league and this girl is one happy bear!</p>
