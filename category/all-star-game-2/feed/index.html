<p>HI GUYS! Remember me? I was wondering if after all these years you&#8217;d like to meet and go over half a season of hockey that I&#8217;ve mostly missed. How does this happen? My life is like space in <em>Interstellar</em>, where time barely passes, while hockey and this blog remain on Earth, getting 80 years older every day without me.</p>
<p>So, All-Star Game?</p>
<p>Is anyone watching this? I kinda sorta almost totally forgot about it until someone mentioned John  Tavares&#8217; pants.</p>

<p>So, Crosby didn&#8217;t get invited. That&#8217;s old news. I wrote a mental blog post called &#8220;10 Things Sid Can Do Instead of the ASG&#8221;, which was quite funny.  You should read it sometime when you develop mind-reading powers.  Or tomorrow, if I get around to posting it.</p>
<p>The newer news is Ovi and Toews are hurt/sick and also suspended. The NHL sure knows how to cry when the whole class doesn&#8217;t come to their party.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alas, with no drunken draft, most of the fun is gone from the weekend anyway. The NHL has realized this too late and made some replacement efforts to attract our attention:</p>
<p><strong>1) Made John Tavares captain.</strong> He probably suggested this <em>Footloose</em>-inspired sobriety nonsense, for fear a real charitable organization might think Ovi was actually poor and needed a new car. The paperwork on that tax headache!  But it does mean more camera time for Captain T and the Pleated Pants.</p>

<p><strong>2) Dierks Bentley.</strong> HOLLER. I love country music, and Dierks is a big Preds fan, and everybody likes tight jeans. He&#8217;ll be one of the celeb coaches at the game.</p>

<p><strong>3) All the Foxy Fridays</strong>. Damn if they didn&#8217;t replace Toews with <a href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2012/08/24/foxy-friday-james-neal/">James Neal</a>. The NHL knew I wasn&#8217;t paying attention and just waved a <del>red</del> ginger flag in my face.</p>

<p><strong>4) 3-on-3 Format.</strong> I won&#8217;t pretend to have an opinion on this, as I&#8217;ve watched approximately one OT period all season, but it sounds exciting. Top players + more open ice = more goals, right? But hasn&#8217;t the All-Star Game always ended in some Hobbit score of twelveses to eleventy anyway? Maybe the &#8220;last place in the draft&#8221; prize can be repurposed to the only player who doesn&#8217;t score a hat trick on Sunday.</p>

<p><strong>5) The John Scott story.</strong> Voted into the ASG by fans, then traded and assigned to the AHL, the saga of whether or not John Scott would appear in the ASG has been ongoing news. Yesterday, Scott published<a href="http://www.theplayerstribune.com/a-guy-like-me/"> this first person account in The Player&#8217;s Tribune</a>. In it, he explains how someone from the NHL encouraged him, even now, not to attend this weekend&#8217;s events.</p>
<p>SCREW YOU, NHL. Wrong, bad, stupid, and also, WHY? John Scott may be the only player who actually cares about this game, and you think he should stay home? Do you think the fans who voted him in should not watch? Oh no, you want them. You NEED them.</p>

	<p class="wp-caption-text">She&#8217;ll be proud.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read the Player&#8217;s Tribune story. It will make you want to buy a John Scott jersey and stand up in your living room when he takes the ice on Sunday. I hope every player shows up wearing his name. You may not like Scott&#8217;s brand of hockey, but it is part of hockey. Scott may not be an elite player, but he is a player. Was a player? Will be an NHL player again? Who knows. But if you love the game, you have to love it&#8217;s scars.</p>
<p>So, see you guys tomorrow night on the Twitters to techno-judge the real skills at Skills Competition: hair, beard, sass? Our trifecta of All-Star Weekend talents.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever found something in the least likely place? Like on <em>The Cosby Show</em>, when Vanessa lost her folder because she&#8217;d accidentally put it back in the freezer with the ice cream? That&#8217;s how we felt a few Fridays back, watching the NHL All-Star Draft.</p>
<p><strong>Foxy Friday: Aaron Ekblad</strong></p>
<div style="width: 505px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ek8.jpg"><img style="width: 495px; max-width: 495px;" title="ek8" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ek8.jpg?w=495" alt="image" width="495" height="278" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">BeardWatch: Rookie of the Year</p></div>
<p>It’s not easy to surprise us with foxiness around the NHL &#8211; so vigilant is our endless search &#8211; and if you get past us, surely our eagle-eyed readers Tweet of a worthy candidate we somehow missed.</p>
<p>Not this time.</p>
<div style="width: 470px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/NHL-ASG-2015-1.jpg"><img style="width: 460px; max-width: 460px;" title="NHL ASG 2015 (1)" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/NHL-ASG-2015-1.jpg?w=460" alt="image" width="460" height="315" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The new guy</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aaron Ekblad walked on stage the ASG Draft and threw our work right out the window.</p>
<div style="width: 474px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ek11.png"><img style="width: 464px; max-width: 464px;" title="ek11" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ek11.png?w=464" alt="image" width="464" height="578" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">21st Century fact-finding mission</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s a lucky thing Aaron was selected for the All-Star Game, or we may have never seen him. I mean <em>never</em>, because that&#8217;s how likely I am to watch a Panthers game. Well, never is a long time for him, so maybe someday. But we probably would have missed this hair:</p>
<div style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ek2.png"><img style="width: 490px; max-width: 490px;" title="ek2" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ek2.png?w=490" alt="image" width="490" height="371" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Never a selfie-stick around when you need one.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Object not, Panthers-fan friends, for my lack of attention to your team probably means they will beat my team in the playoffs. You’re welcome. Love, Karma)</p>
<p>In addition to the perfect boyband bangswave, Aaron is 6&#8217;4&#8243;, 216 lbs… and was born in 1996. Just a reminder! He was drafted first overall in 2014. Usually, draft photos are what we pull up eight years later to laugh about. Where is whoever writes this blog in 2023 going to get her comedy material?</p>
<div style="width: 457px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ek4.jpg"><img style="width: 447px; max-width: 447px;" title="ek4" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ek4.jpg?w=447" alt="image" width="447" height="496" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Stop. Let me get a good look at it.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aaron had 4 assists for the victorious Team Toews in the All-Star Game.  Not surprising, as he&#8217;s got 21A on the season and a total of 28 points. Who else has 28 points this season? James Neal.</p>
<p>Not bad, Aaron.</p>
<div style="width: 497px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ek3.jpg"><img style="width: 487px; max-width: 487px;" title="ek3" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ek3.jpg?w=487" alt="image" width="487" height="459" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>The Cutting Edge</em> pre-dates Aaron by four years.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case you momentarily forgot Aaron is 18, one of his favorite movies is “That Awkward Moment” – which is an awkward moment when someone’s favorite movie stars Zac Efron. Not knocking Zac, just admiring the bottomless chasm of age difference. [ More favorites <a href="http://panthers.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=729469">here</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/story/_/id/11633999/nhl-qa-florida-panthers-aaron-ekblad">here/video</a>.] You know that Saved By the Bell Jimmy Fallon thing everyone is talking about? I bet Aaron&#8217;s never heard of Zack Morris.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.twitter.com/FLAPanthers">@FLAPanthers</a> (which always reads &#8220;Flap Antlers&#8221; to me) are, by all accounts, in much better shape this year than last.</p>
<div style="width: 557px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ek6.png"><img style="width: 547px; max-width: 547px;" title="ek6" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ek6.png?w=547" alt="image" width="547" height="362" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Florida Department of Tourism Meeting</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I mean on the ice, you guys. They are currently 9th in the East with 56 points &#8211; ahead of the Flyers (52), trailing the Bruins (61). Still plenty of time left for everything to go right or wrong.</p>
<div style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ek6.jpg"><img style="width: 502px; max-width: 502px;" title="ek6" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ek6.jpg?w=502" alt="image" width="502" height="276" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">First year playoff hopes</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ekblad, along with his ASG mates Filip Forsberg (who the Caps traded away for nothing) and Johnny Gaudreau (who I will never, ever call &#8220;Johnny Hockey&#8221;), are frontrunners for the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year. [Intern Jeff Skinner just harrumphed and walked out.] With half this season left to go, it&#8217;s safe to say that Aaron is our pick. After all, he didn&#8217;t go to Boston College.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ugh, sorry. I bet I&#8217;ve used a version of that headline for every All-Star Game post in the history of this blog! Smashmouth is not really a place I want to revisit, but it will forever associate with these events.</p>
<p>The complete list of players selected for the All-Star Game in Columbus on Jan 25 has been announced, but let&#8217;s start with the fan vote roster. Which looks like the Blackhawks roster.</p>

<p>You may note a few things once your eyes adjust to all those Hawks logos:</p>
<p>1. NO CROSBY. Just in the fan vote, obviously, but Mr. Popularity, was not crowned Homecoming King this year. He can still call me if he needs a date, though. I am not so fickle.</p>

<p>2. What is a Zemgus Girgensons and how did it <del>escape Middle Earth</del> win the fan vote? This phenomenon was well-documented, so it didn&#8217;t exactly come out of nowhere (anymore than it completely came out of nowhere). Zemgus, who is 21 and plays in Buffalo, hails from Latvia. So mobilized were the 2 million people of his home country, they apparently did nothing but vote online for for the NHL ASG. Right to the top!</p>

	<p class="wp-caption-text">What does high score mean? Did I break it?</p></div>
<p>Some people say this is a tawdry exploitation of the game&#8217;s selection process. I say: YOU ARE NO FUN, partypoopers! It&#8217;s one roster spot. It&#8217;s the ASG, which is really just an excuse to look good during the skills competition. Guys who don&#8217;t get picked <strong>get to go on vacation </strong>and don&#8217;t have to pose for <a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/2011/01/31/mikey-monday-8/">&#8217;80s prom photos</a>. Sure, it&#8217;s an honor to be voted in, but let&#8217;s be real. Zemgus plays in Buffalo.  This might be the only thing he ever wins. I hope he enjoys the heck out of it.</p>
<p>3. Kane beat Toews. I love this. Just as Jon became more fun, Kaner became more serious. For next year&#8217;s campaign, they should do a full-length <em>Grease</em> remake. From:</p>

<p>The list is&#8230; confusing. Or perhaps it&#8217;s &#8220;avant garde&#8221; and I never really understood that kind of art anyway. No Nicklas Backstrom, fantasy point machine.  No James Neal&#8217;s hair blowing in the shot accuracy competition breeze. (That&#8217;ll teach you to get yourself traded away from Malkin&#8230; to a team leading the League. Figures.) No Chara, Zetterbeard or Datsyuk, no Sedins and no PK Subban. Remember that time he wore Intern Jeff Skinner&#8217;s jersey? Ah, those were the days.  Puck Daddy has some more snub thoughts <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/nhl-2015-all-stars-announced--who-was-snubbed-233642200.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Those who did make the cut will be wearing these sweaters. When the ASG is over, I hope they are donated to live out the rest of their unsightly lives in relative dignity as Major League Soccer referee jerseys.</p>

<p>Laviolette and Sutter will coach. Two team captains (and two alternates per team) will be announced next week, and they will hold the fantasy draft on Friday, January 23 at 8 PM (on NBCSN in the States). The draft is my favorite part of the weekend, even eclipsing the skills competition. Someone will get picked last, someone will trip going up the steps.  Hugs will happen. John Tavares will be there.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/sbBalgzSwBQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p style="text-align: center;">Look at his middle-school-boy handwriting.</p>
<p>Overall, it sounds a heck of a lot better than my average Friday night.  So we&#8217;ll see you there (er, <em>here</em>) for ASG Weekend!</p>

<p>Ovi has a crush on him too &#8211; and who wouldn&#8217;t? I think pretty  much all hockey players would put Kris at the top of all their lists.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Mr. Pants and I boarded our flight in Houston on Saturday, I had NO idea there would be individual TVs on the plane.  Then I saw the All-Star Game Skills Competition was on.  I may have screamed.  One swipe of the AMEX later, I was sitting an inch from the screen with a huge smile on my face.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Pants: &#8220;What are you so happy about?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Obviously he doesn&#8217;t share my pain in missing a week of hockey and the ASG Draft, or as we prefer to think of it, <strong>The WUYS Bachelor Auction</strong>.  I&#8217;m sure it was great.  And I saw they put Letang in the front row because even he can only get away with tripping once.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/vBpVaqsPDtE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>The Elimination Shootout started as we reached cruising altitude.  Stamkos stepped up&#8230; and the pilot came on the PA talking about miles programs and tail winds and how, if you looked out the right side, you could see a chicken in Mississippi riding a bicycle.  He talked the ENTIRE TIME!   <strong>We almost had an incident with Homeland Security.</strong>  Plus the seatbelt sign was on forever and I really had to pee.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/3uWy8kZT9JQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>During the post-win interview, I lost it and said, <strong>&#8220;Stop touching him, Pierre!&#8221;</strong> really loud.  Unless Pierre has scissors, though it doesn&#8217;t look like he&#8217;d know how to cut hair.</p>

<p>Also, it&#8217;s not easy to watch Nealmobile do Accuracy Shooting when it&#8217;s illegal for me to scream, run around or throw things.  As I watch back through the coverage, the ASG never fails to be a highlight of the season.  <strong>It brainwashes me</strong> into a maniac who thinks things like:</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/ahoYD3OJeQQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p><strong>Red heads in pink shirts</strong>?  Sure, why not!  Too bad no one could straighten it out before shooting.  Unless Giroux&#8217;s going to tear it off, it shouldn&#8217;t be stretched like that.  My inner publicist cringes.  (Note: That plaid jacket still needs to go. Along with Neal&#8217;s. Were they on sale in Ontario at some point?)</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/zxDHqkSKZS0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p><strong>Carey Price is funny</strong>.  And charming.  I didn&#8217;t think this could get worse.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZDxZP3fnWhU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>Scott Hartnell + the Sedins = my nightmare.  Except it&#8217;s fantastic.</p>
<p>And some things&#8217;s don&#8217;t surprise.  <strong>Henrik Lundqvist puts everyone to shame</strong>, in every category.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/akh-_U9sJBA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t think <strong>Patrick Kane would steal the show</strong> then you must be new around here.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>All-Star Weekend</strong> is our 2nd favorite time of the year here at WUYS (behind the awkberg assemblage that is the NHL Awards) and since Pants is off on her honeymoon getting all tan, hanging with monkeys, drinking umbrella drinks and being all in lurve, it&#8217;s going to be really lonely around here this weekend.</p>
<p>So to brighten my spirits and entertain myself for the next few days,  I&#8217;ve devised a little <strong>All-Star Weekend Drinking Game</strong>.</p>
<p>Because, really nothing says &#8220;fun&#8221; like hockey, hockey players, and a little booze.</p>
<p>Just ask Patrick Kane.  Or Brad Marchand.  Or Tyler Seguin.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The All-Star Weekend Drinking Game</strong><br />
<em>(suitable for all events &#8211; Fantasy Draft, Skills Competition, &amp; the game itself)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>When they show a player laughing&#8230;drink.</li>
<li>When they show a player taking a photo/video&#8230;drink</li>
<li>When they cut to Phil Kessel&#8230;drink.</li>
<li>When they show the Sedin Twins&#8230;drink.</li>
<li>When the last player is selected&#8230;throw your hands up in the air.  Then drink.</li>
<li>When they mention a player out &#8220;due to injury&#8221;…make a sad face.  Then drink.</li>
<li>When a player goes to block a shot&#8230;scream &#8220;SACRIFICE YOUR BODY!&#8221;</li>
<li>When Kris Letang goes to block a shot&#8230;scream &#8220;NOT THE FACE!&#8221;</li>
<li>If they get hurt&#8230;finish the bottle.</li>
<li>When they show any hockey bromance&#8230;say &#8220;Awwwww&#8221;. Then drink.</li>
<li>When they show a player with beautiful hockey flow&#8230;whip your hair back and forth.  Then drink.</li>
<li>When someone falls down during the Fastest Skater competition&#8230;drink.</li>
<li>If its a goalie&#8230;drink twice.</li>
<li>When someone passes the 100mph mark during the Hardest Shot competition&#8230;drink.</li>
<li>When someone goes 4 for 4 on the Accuracy competition&#8230;drink.</li>
<li>When someone does something crazy during the Elimination Shootout&#8230;drink.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a feeling I&#8217;m going to get really drunk this weekend&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>So, WUYSers, what other rules would you add to your ASG Drinking Game?</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tonight, we&#8217;ll find out who&#8217;ll be the <strong>Phil Kessel of the 2012 All Star game.  </strong>(Perhaps it&#8217;ll be Phil Kessel.  That would be amazing.)</p>
<p>At 8pm tonight, fifty of the best hockey players in the world (38 NHL All-Stars and 12 top rookies) will be up for selection in the <strong>Player Fantasy Draft</strong>.  All-stars and rookies will be divided into two teams  &#8211; <strong>Team Alfredsson</strong> (aka Team Pants), led by captain Daniel Alfredsson and assistant captain Henrik Lundqvist, and <strong>Team Chara</strong> (aka Team Chuck), led by captain Zdeno &#8220;Z-Big&#8221; Chara and assistant captain Joffrey Lupul.</p>

<p>Quick refresher on how the Fantasy Draft works&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>A coin toss will decide first pick, with Alfredsson and Chara, joined by their assistant captains, alternately drafting the All-Stars through 19 rounds</li>
<li>Each team will consist of three goaltenders, six defensemen and 12 forwards</li>
<li>Each team&#8217;s three goalies must be picked by the end of Round 10</li>
<li>Each team&#8217;s six defensemen must be picked by the conclusion of Round 15</li>
<li>The 12 Rookies will be divided by the National Hockey League into two groups of six.  At the completion of the 15th round of the draft, one NHL Rookie will be selected to choose which All-Star team his group will join for the skills competition</li>
<li>As a reward (consolation?), the final player selected in the draft will have $20,000 donated to the grassroots hockey program of his choice</li>
</ul>
<p>So who&#8217;s up for grabs?</p>

</table>
<p>After he was selected as a captain, Chara did mention that he was going to take this draft very seriously and do as much research as possible, so it will be interesting to see what his strategy will be.  Think he hit up Bruins GM Peter Chiarelli for some pointers?</p>
<p>Will he take his teammate &amp; Vezina winning goaltender <strong>Tim Thomas</strong> with the first pick?  Or will the events of this week and the recent revelation that Thomas does not have many friends amoungst his teammates sway Chara&#8217;s decision?</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m no prognosticator, but I can tell you <strong>what you will see tonight</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ridiculous amounts of awkwardness.</li>
<li>The Sedins  on different teams.</li>
<li>Kris Letang&#8217;s hair looking awesome.</li>
<li>James Neal&#8217;s hair looking like a porcupine.</li>
<li>Scott Hartnell&#8217;s hair looking like a hot mess cavewoman hooker.</li>
<li>Tight bums.</li>
<li>Patrick Kane calling Toews to tell him he misses him.</li>
<li>Awkward interview with last two players remaining.</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing you won&#8217;t see&#8230;</p>

<p>Another thing I&#8217;ve missed up until now is the <strong>NHL All-Star Game voting</strong>.</p>

<p>I restricted my choices to people currently playing.  Obviously I believe Crosby should be in &#8211; he was more of an all-star in his few games this year than most people are in a whole season.  But if he&#8217;s well, he&#8217;ll get in.  (See the leaderboard <a href="http://vote.nhl.com/:b=chrome/#/leaderboard">here</a>.)   I deliberately sent my votes where they can count.</p>
<p><strong>1) Nicklas Backstrom</strong> &#8211; If Ovi gets in and Nicky doesn&#8217;t, someone will receive a strongly worded letter written in cut-out magazine letters.</p>

<p><strong>2) Jonathan Toews</strong> &#8211; scored his 300th career point last night, overall superstar and BAMF.  You don&#8217;t see a lake named after anyone else.</p>

<p><strong>3) James Neal</strong> &#8211; needs no explanation. HONK!</p>

<p><strong>4) Duncan Keith</strong> &#8211; Did you see him rob Matt Cullen on a shorthanded breakaway last night?  Norris Trophy, what?</p>

<p><strong>5) Shea Weber</strong> &#8211; 100+ MPH shot, massive blocking body, all-star playoff beard, friends with Dierks Bentley.  Scored from the cheap seats (and we mean in the net!).  Haven&#8217;t seen it?  Puck Daddy has it, they always do [<a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/blog/puck_daddy/post/Video-Watch-Shea-Weber-8217-s-ridiculous-goal-?urn=nhl-wp19745">link</a>].</p>

<p><strong>6) Marc-Andre Fleury</strong> &#8211; Forever holding it down in the back, never knowing who might be available to stand in front of him every night.  And for the off chance he&#8217;ll spin like a ballerina or sass Carey Price.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[brightcove vid=557985342001&amp;exp3=594258040001&amp;surl=http://c.brightcove.com/services&amp;pubid=1815805388&amp;pk=AQ~~,AAAAAGw6_cw~,orja1xhYdu3rs6LhvI2eES_NASP2XRmD&amp;w=416&amp;h=312]</p>
<p>OK, I will confess to being a bit of a Classical Music nerd having sat through Wagner&#8217;s Ring Cycle &#8211; and no, that is not a horror movie trilogy. I was watching Dancing with the Stars so I could watch Maks drop Kristie Alley again like a shot putter over loaded at the Olympics! But instead, Mr. Cherrie found me talking to the TV at this Hottie for Classical Music theme night. I just rolled my eyes and told Mr. Cherrie I could see through the window dressing and that his guy was GOOD &#8211; no GREAT! <strong>He can play &#8220;The Flight of Bumble Bee&#8221; in 66 seconds &#8211; a world record!</strong></p>
<p>And then I thought, &#8220;Hey &#8211; we had a blow out last year about  &#8211; he who I won&#8217;t name for fear of being flash mobbed by his fans again &#8211; <strong>WHY NOT start early and suggest David Garrett?</strong> International yet Half-American! Young, hip and HOT! I think this would work! Hockey fans might actually appreciate this guy who would bring some flash and totally rock BOTH anthems &#8220;O Canada&#8221; and &#8220;The Star Spangle Banner&#8221; &#8211; ala Jimi Hendrix Style and bring some much needed Pazzaz to the game. Oh say can you see &#8230; Oh hell yes! I say!</p>
<p>I know it&#8217;s the play-offs and why am I going on about the All-Star game? BECAUSE &#8230; that&#8217;s how my brain works sisters. You should all know that by now! And BTW &#8211; you should totally down load ROCK SYMPHONIES on iTunes like, NOW because you will LOVE IT!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After the All Star game if you google Ovechkin and Letang, all sorts of yummy things start to come up. But I think this is where it all began.

<p>Can&#8217;t wait for the next Pens VS Caps game! I wonder if Ovi is going to take Kris out to dinner afterwards or if they are just going to get down to business?</p>

Below is the Sports Centre highlight of the Mad Skills wrap up if you want to watch.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='480' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/AaJL6q5O3CQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>So here are my highlights and lowlights of the ASG weekend in no particular order:</p>
<p>1. Only in Canada would they <strong>NOT</strong> go to the All Star Game because the <strong>Grand-Slam of Curling is going into Over Time</strong>. Leaving me running around the house in a panic while a large rock slowly drifts down a long runway while a bunch of men rub brushes in front of it.</p>
<p>2. Jonathan Towes is a bit of a gash. Sorry Pants. This weekend only made me dislike him more. He&#8217;s a bit a cry-baby. And I think his team mates think so too. Which is why they did what they did.</p>
<p>3. On the other hand, Jeff Skinner made like the Grinch and STOLE THE ASG weekend! At 18 years old he showed poise, sportsmanship and a knock out smile. Watch out for this one!</p>
<p>4. The CBC mic&#8217;d up Eric Staal the whole game. All I can say is, next year, please put this game on HBO and mic up Fleury because you know Fleury was talking smack all first period. Micing up E. Staal is like micing up Ned Flanders or a bowl of vanilla ice cream, only vanilla ice cream doesn&#8217;t scream like a girl, totes seriously. My cats were really upset during the game.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2775" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ned-flanders1.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2775" title="ned-flanders[1]" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ned-flanders1.jpg?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ned-flanders1.jpg 320w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ned-flanders1-150x150.jpg 150w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ned-flanders1-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">oh gosh ...golly ... I gotta go get that .. acckk!</p></div>5. Contrarily, the third period when Tim Thomas was mic&#8217;d, he was hilarious. Especially</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2776" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/vc127425l1.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2776" title="VC127425l[1]" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/vc127425l1.jpg?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="122" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/vc127425l1.jpg 400w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/vc127425l1-300x244.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">please don&#039;t insult me with that comparison</p></div>when the announcers wouldn&#8217;t stop talking to him and his son texted and told him to stop so Timmy could concentrate! Then they asked about Letang scoring on him Timmy said, &#8220;I made three mistakes on that one: first I didn&#8217;t see the backcheck, second I expected him to pass and third, he took the shot and went up on me. hahahahha.&#8221;</p>
<p>6.Danny Briere. Now I don&#8217;t like him &#8211; AT ALL. And initially I didn&#8217;t think he should be there. But after the CBC interviewed him and his three kids, I&#8217;ve done a 180. When they asked his son what was the best part of the weekend, his son said, &#8220;Spending time with my dad.&#8221; Danny seemed to really need to be there more for his kids&#8217; sake then his ego and watching his son give the interview, Danny seemed on the verge of tears. Strange family dynamics going on there but he obviously really cares about his kids and it meant alot to him to have them there. Total Hallmark moment.</p>
<p>7. The CBC interviewing Fleury about his chat with Ovi after Ovi scored on him in the breakaway challenge. One thing you have to love CBC interviews is there are never any warm up questions. They cut to the chase. So when Scott Oakes opens the interview with Fleury saying, &#8220;So obviously this isn&#8217;t the first time Ovi has scored on you.&#8221;  Nice. Way to warm him up. Awkward. Then he continues asking about the intense rivalry between The Caps and The Penguins and what would they have to talk about. So Fleury just replies, &#8221; I try to remain civil, you know, not throw my stick at him.&#8221; with a big smile. Way to make Scott Oakes go away.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2778" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1086246122.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2778" title="108624612[2]" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1086246122.jpg?w=200" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1086246122.jpg 396w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1086246122-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">what is happening to me? two penguins in a post?</p></div>8. Almost lastly, no matter how much this game &#8216;doesn&#8217;t count&#8217; the first period started out nonchalant but then it got competitive. Not super competitive but you could tell no wanted it be a landslide either way. So when Kris Letang almost took Jonas Hiller&#8217;s head off with a seriously hard shot, he went over to apologize. Even he doesn&#8217;t realize how awesomely hard his shot it.</p>
<p>9. Mike Green a.k.a. Where&#8217;s Waldo? When ever the CBC showed Ovi you got a shot of Kris Letang, which for me, was AWESOME. I already did a post on the best thing that came out of the ASG! I expected to see Mike Green but I got KL. But like, where did Mike Green go? Did he and Ovi have a fight? Was Greenie upset because he got ditched for Kris? Can I blame Ovi?</p>
<p>10. The BEST COMMENT FROM AN ANNOUNCER ON A GOAL EVER: When Briere made his second goal: &#8220;BRIERE JUST WENT UPSTAIRS WHERE NORMAN KEEPS HIS MOTHER!&#8221;</p>
