<p>But unfortunately it is not.</p>
<p>Game 6 really did happen.</p>
<p>The Bruins really did lose.</p>
<p>That stupid totem fell over.</p>

<p>What happened on Monday night was like a punch to the solar plexus.  All your air expelled from your body so rapidly, leaving you desperate to catch your breath while your lungs burn and struggle.</p>
<p>Since that night, I&#8217;ve taken the time to reflect on it all and I&#8217;m now at a point where I can talk about it without getting all teary-eyed.   The melancholy has faded and been replaced by an overwhelming sense of pride in my hockey club.</p>
<p>Despite the horrible way that it all ended, I still love this Bruins team.  In fact, I love them even more than I did at the start of the season.  They showed a grit, determination, and unity of which they, their fans, and the city of Boston should be exceptionally proud.  They bared their heart and souls and laid everything out there on the line.  They got their chance at the Cup.  But it just wasn&#8217;t meant to be.</p>
<p>Thank you, Patrice Bergeron, for just being amazing and perfect.  Seriously.  Even Pants (who hates the Bruins with the fire of a thousand suns) will admit that she respects #37.   His man is without a doubt the heart and soul of this Bruins team.   Patrice Bergeron is the sun, the rest of the Bruins, the planets which orbit in his golden glow.</p>
<p>Bergeron is not the flashiest player, nor is his visage is not posted in the windows of the NHL store.</p>
<p>But there is no denying that he is one of the fiercest competitor in the NHL.  He played Game 6 with a separated shoulder, a broken rib, AND torn rib cartilage.</p>
<p>Do you know what a broken rib feels like?  Imagine that every time you take a deep breathe in or out, it feels like you are being stabbed with a knife.</p>
<p>So, ya&#8230;that&#8217;s fun.</p>

	</p>
<p>In countless post game interviews, the Bruins players talked about how much they loved each other and what it was to play together.  We joke about the Seguin/Marchand bromance, but it seems as though the whole Bruins team was just one big collective bromance.</p>
<p>

	</p>
<p>This is a team that was virtually unchanged since their 2011 Stanley Cup win.  That run a mere two years ago solidified this unbreakable bond.  I imagine that the Bruins are much like a band of brothers who in war time would give their heart, soul, and lay down their lives for each other. Just look at Gregory Campbell.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t take anything away from what the Hawks did in this lockout shortened season.  From the get-go, the Hawks were the best team in the league.  If anyone deserved to win, it was them.</p>
<p>Their history making win streak to start the season set a pace and expectation that the Hawks ultimately lived up to.  They stumbled a bit, had some hard-fought playoff series wins, and while it wasn&#8217;t perfect, the shiny fruit of their labor is all that really matters.</p>
<p>As much as I want to hate the Hawks, I can&#8217;t.  They are an exceptional hockey club and it would be foolish of me as a hockey fan to deride them and their obvious talent simply because they beat my beloved Bruins.</p>
<p>I think what makes it all so heart-wrenching is how it all went down.  With so little time left and the Bruins within reach of forcing a game 7, the Hawks came in like some magicians and swiped that tablecloth from right underneath my good china.  It all went crashing to the floor, shattering into a million little pieces.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m starting to glue the pieces back together, but it is  going to take me some time.  Like all summer.</p>
<p>The post-game interviews&#8230;I still can&#8217;t watch.  The thought of teary-eyed Tyler Seguin and sad panda face Patrice Bergeron is all too much.   I just want to reach through the screen and pull them in for a great big hug.</p>

<p>If only game 6 had been 58 minutes instead of 60 &#8211; what would have happened then?</p>
<p>Maybe game 7 would led the Bruins to the Cup or maybe the outcome would have been exactly the same.  It is impossible to know.</p>
<p>What I do know is that this is a Bruins team that is something truly special.  We&#8217;ll have to see what the off-season has in store for us.  Who will come and who will go?</p>
<p>But come October, you know where to find me.  Decked out in my Black and Gold, ready for another run at the Cup.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me preface this by saying that I&#8217;m not typically a girl that goes to bars alone.</p>
<p>Mainly, because it makes me feel more acutely single than I already do and also because I try not to drink alone.</p>
<p>Last Friday, I set aside my rule and ventured out to my local in the pouring rain to watch Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals.</p>
<p>And when I mean pouring rain, I mean <em>pouring</em>, cats and dogs, Noah&#8217;s Ark type rain.</p>
<p>My roommate was away for the weekend.  I didn&#8217;t feel like cooking.  And I wasn&#8217;t about to watch the Bruins sweep the Penguins alone.  I needed to be around my people.</p>
<p>For sixty minutes, I was just a cacophony of emotions. Elation. Joy. Fear. Anxiety.</p>
<p>Good thing I was in a place with an endless supply of alcohol.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I get my drink, order me ups some delicious fish tacos, and get it going.</p>

			</span>

	</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that is pretty much the way I felt the entire weekend.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure that Pens&#8217; fans have some choice words to describe this series.  As a Bruins fan, I have only one.</p>
<p>Domination.</p>
<p>From the drop of the puck in Game 1 till the final buzzer on Friday,  the Bruins straight up dominated the Penguins.  They managed to shut down the Penguins&#8217; high powered offense and render Crosby, Malkin, and Neal virtually non existent.</p>
<p>The players that should have been factors for the Pens were not, thanks to an far superior Bruins&#8217; defensive corps and a goaltender that was all sorts of bad-ass.</p>

			</span>
		</span>
	</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the ECF, the Bruins gave a complete, standing-ovation performance.  They played as one, collective Borg hockey unit.  They were all in from the beginning.</p>
<p>No egos, no excuses. Just hockey.</p>
<p>Pants gets upset when people criticizes Crosby and blame him for his team&#8217;s loss.  And justifiably so.  One player does not a team make. There are 19 other guys on that Penguins bench.</p>
<p>Simple fact is that for those 4 games, the Bruins were better.  They were the best team.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve known from the beginning of the season that Bruins were a great team capable of winning the Stanley Cup again.</p>
<p>Now so does everyone else.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While credit goes to Bergeron for scoring the goal, mad props go to <strong>Jaromir Jagr</strong> for making it all possible.  <strong>His play on Evgeni Malkin</strong> along the boards makes that goal possible.</p>
<p>Forget the fact that Jagr is practically pre-historic in hockey years &#8211; he is still got it. Oh and Brad Marchand&#8217;s pass wasn&#8217;t so bad either.</p>
<p>Gregory Campbell is wicked hahd corah.  He blocked a Malkin shot and remained on the ice as the Penguins continued to pressure on the power play.</p>
<p>We all know Campbell is one bad mamma jamma, but this was just amazing.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/h15m87WsCHQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first I was all &#8220;Why is he limping to the side like his leg was broken? This ain&#8217;t no time for the Humpty Dance!&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, turns out the Campbell&#8217;s leg was, in fact, broken.  Just to reiterate &#8211; Campbell played that whole time <strong>WITH A BROKEN LEG!</strong> I will cut anyone who says that hockey players aren&#8217;t the toughest athletes out there.</p>
<p>Campbell is done for the remainder of the playoffs and the Bruins will miss his physicality and depth. However, I have a feeling that his steely determination and self-sacrifice will serve to be an inspiration for his teammates as they prepare for Game 4 and the potential sweep.</p>
<p>David Krejci&#8217;s campaign for the Conn Smythe continues.  He is out there shaking hands and kissing babies&#8230;and getting all the points. He scored his 9th goal of the playoff and remains as the league&#8217;s #1 point-getter this post season with 21 points.</p>

<p>Penguins did play their best game of the series last night&#8230;but the Bruins were just a little bit better.</p>
<p>Vokoun recovered well from his first two performances and was excellent in net&#8230;but Tuukaa was better.</p>

<p>Although the series is now at 3-0 Bruins, this series, and the playoffs in general, have been anything but easy for the Bruins. Just look at Bergeron&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>His<strong> bruised and battered visage is a testament to how hard the Bruins have been working</strong>, not only in this series but the entire playoffs.</p>
<p>After their Game 7 victory over the Leafs, the Bs seemed to have flipped a switch and reverted to the way they played in their 2011 run to the Stanley Cup.  They are<strong> mucking and grinding and playing with a grit and grime that has been their calling card</strong>. It might not always be pretty and the goals might not make it to the Top 10 on NHL Network, but they are <strong>getting it done when it counts the most</strong>.  They are a team that has committed themselves to leave it all out there on the ice, each and every time.</p>
<p>Game 4 is Friday in Boston and the Bruins will have the chance to close out the series with a sweep of the Pens.  If you had told me at the beginning of the playoffs that this is where we&#8217;d be right now, I would have called you crazy.</p>

	<em>Say what now?</em></p>
<p>We both would have. The Pens regular season domination was enough to make anyone believe that their road to the Stanley Cup Finals was all but assured.</p>
<p>But the NHL Playoffs are a fickle thing.  They can dismantle contenders with incredible ease.  Or make champions out of underdogs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Maybe our pre-season predictions weren&#8217;t perfect, but we&#8217;re hoping for more luck with these.  If we picked our own teams to advance it&#8217;s because we feel they can.  We know they will.  Nothing else is acceptable, RIGHT?</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16237" alt="psych2" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/psych2.jpg" width="448" height="216" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/psych2.jpg 560w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/psych2-300x144.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/psych2-500x241.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Yet we remind ourselves, and you, these are the Stanley Cup Playoffs.  <strong>No team is safe.</strong>  Not even the #1 seed.</p>
<hr />
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Pittsburgh (1) vs. NY Islanders (8)</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Chuck: Penguins</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let’s be honest here &#8211; can anyone beat the Pens right now? It’ll be nigh impossible to stop the Pens on their quest for the Cup.  We’re delighted that they Isles made the big show and excited that our favorite middle school science teacher, <a title="Foxy Friday: John Tavares" href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/2012/03/02/foxy-friday-john-tavares/">John Tavares</a>, finally has the chance to show off his exceptional skill in the post-season.  He could break out but this series is all Pens.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pants:  Penguins</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is too tough a 1st round draw for the Isles.  The Penguins drop players like kids drop crayons &#8211; they can still make a picture, but one color always seems to be missing.  Now it&#8217;s: Avengers, ASSEMBLE.  Expect Crosby to be unlike we&#8217;ve ever seen him.  There is nothing he (and I) would like better than to take his injuries, time missed and all the shit-talk and shove it down every other team&#8217;s throat until they choke.  Whew&#8230; I need to calm down.  Is it Wednesday yet?</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16246" alt="pens" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pens2.jpg" width="441" height="245" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pens2.jpg 630w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pens2-300x166.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pens2-500x277.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px" /></p>
<hr />
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Montreal (2) vs. Ottawa (7)</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Chuck:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Apparently, Erik Karlsson has Wolverine X-Men-like healing ability and boy are the Senators glad to have him back.  His return to the lineup will no doubt lift the Senators’ game. He makes all around him better and that is what his team needs to challenge the Habs.   So goes Carey Price, so go the Habs. He’ll need to be stellar this series for the Canadiens to advance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pants: Canadiens</p>
<p dir="ltr">Or alternatively: I don&#8217;t care about this series.  If the East sees an upset I think this would be it.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Washington Capitals (3) vs. New York Rangers (6)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chuck: Rangers</p>
<p dir="ltr">Good looks can only get you so far and Rangers are going to have their hands full with one of the NHL’s hottest teams.  Caps’ PP is en fuego and Ovechkin has poured it on in the last few weeks (14 goals in April!).  But the Rangers have Lundqvist and a solid defensive corps.  Look for the McDonough/Ovechkin match up alot this series.  I&#8217;m glad that our friendship is strong and based on more than just hockey because this series will put it to the test.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pants: Capitals</p>
<p dir="ltr">I believe in the Caps.  Hell, I even believe in Ovi for the last two months.  He is right now the unstoppable, force-of-nature player of years past.  Like then, he brings Nicky and Mikey right up with him.  Add in scrappy players who rise to playoff occasion &#8211; Chimera, Hendricks, Beagle, Ward &#8211; and it&#8217;s talent on top off tenacity.  I <del>think</del> <del>feel</del> <del>hope</del> know it&#8217;s going to happen.  The red is ready to rock.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16247" alt="caps rags" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/caps-rags.jpg" width="445" height="229" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/caps-rags.jpg 618w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/caps-rags-300x153.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/caps-rags-500x256.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px" /></p>
<hr />
<p dir="ltr">Boston Bruins (4) vs. Toronto Maple Leafs (5)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chuck:  Bruins</p>
<p dir="ltr">Original Six Match-Up! Bring it on! Bruins won the season series 3-1, but have slumped in the last dozen games.  Leafs have been a better team than they have in the past &#8211;  Kessel, Lupul, Van Riemsdyk, and the emergence of Kadri have lifted the Leafs to the #5 seed.  If Bruins want to win this series, they need to play “their game” &#8211; physical, punishing, bear-like.  Lucic, Horton, and Marchand need to step up.  Tuukka has played well in the net and it&#8217;s his time to shine as the Bruins #1.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pants: Bruins</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Bruins are bigger and badder &#8211; and if they lose this series, it will be because they beat themselves.  Nice to see the Leafs make the dance, though.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16248" alt="bs leafs" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bs-leafs.jpg" width="438" height="322" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bs-leafs.jpg 548w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bs-leafs-300x220.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bs-leafs-500x366.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px" /></p>
<hr />
<p dir="ltr">Chicago (1) vs. Minnesota (8)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chuck: Blackhawks</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hop on board the Blackhawks Train! Choo Choo! This team has been on-point from Day 1 of the season and honestly, the Western Conference is theirs to lose.  The Wild just squeaked into the #8 slot by winning their last regular season game. Suter has played well as of late after a rocky start in Minnesota and of course, there is Parise, but it is going to be hard to get past Crawford and Company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pants: Blackhawks</p>
<p dir="ltr">Remember in 2010, when you felt like you were watching magic happen?  That&#8217;s been going on since January, and it ain&#8217;t over yet.  There is <em>almost</em> no one I&#8217;d rather watch in the playoffs than Jonathan Toews &#8211; he is the epitome of a competitor and a captain.  That game-tying, short handed, under 2 minutes left goal to send Game 7 to OT vs Vancouver in the first round of 2011 still rips out my beating heart like we&#8217;re in the <em>Temple of Doom</em>.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16249" alt="hawks wild" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hawks-wild.jpg" width="455" height="308" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hawks-wild.jpg 650w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hawks-wild-300x203.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hawks-wild-500x338.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px" /></p>
<hr />
<p dir="ltr">Anaheim (2) vs. Detroit (7)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chuck: Ducks</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Ducks are a team that have flown under the radar all season.  (Flown.  The Ducks. See what I did there?)  Detroit has made the playoffs for the 22nd straight season.  Ducks have a great goaltending tandem with Fasth and Hiller.  Detroit has a phalanx of talented forwards.  Series should be fun to watch but I think Anaheim comes out on top.  I weep at the thought of no Zetterberg playoff beard. WEEP.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pants: Ducks</p>
<p dir="ltr">I don&#8217;t think the Ducks have been under the radar, just far away.  They won all but 2 games in February, so right away they were good and loud about it.  This is the Ducks team we should have seen last year, plus I miss Bruce Boudreau&#8217;s red, screaming face.  And Teemu Selanne cannot actually play forever, despite appearances.  Getcha some Haagen-Dazs<b><b> </b></b>for this one.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16250" alt="ducsk wigns" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ducsk-wigns.jpg" width="467" height="297" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ducsk-wigns.jpg 584w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ducsk-wigns-300x190.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ducsk-wigns-500x317.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px" /></p>
<hr />
<p dir="ltr">Vancouver (3) vs. San Jose (6)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chuck: Sharks</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the Canucks are to have any chance on winning this series, Cory Schneider &amp; Ryan Kesler need to be healthy.  Sharks won season series 3-0, have a proven Stanley Cup goalie and a boat-load of forwards led by Joe Thornton, Joe Pavelski, and our favorite caveman, Brent Burns.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pants: Sharks</p>
<p>San Jose, the NHL&#8217;s streakiest team.  Remember how hot they were to begin the season?  If they can find the winning formula again, it&#8217;ll be the Conference Final before anyone knows what hit &#8217;em.  Then the Sharks will choke, because that&#8217;s how they do in playoffs.  At least they&#8217;ll have taken Vancouver out first.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16251" alt="sharks canucks" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sharks-canucks.jpg" width="490" height="304" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sharks-canucks.jpg 612w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sharks-canucks-300x186.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sharks-canucks-500x310.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></p>
<hr />
<p dir="ltr">St. Louis (4) vs. Los Angeles (5)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chuck: Kings</p>
<p dir="ltr">No way the defending Stanley Cup Champs are going down without a fight and I still think they&#8217;ll take the series, but if Backes steps up, this series could go either way.  Sure, the Blues may have lost to the Kings 8 times in a row but like the Black Eyed Peas &#8211; I got a feeling.  The Blues do have a shot.  Both teams play a similar game but Blues&#8217; goaltending has been slightly better, so you can see my dilemma.</p>
<p>Pants: Blues</p>
<p>The more I think about it, the more I like the Blues here.  They&#8217;re pissed LA swept them out last season.  They&#8217;ve won 12 of 15 in April, and 10 of those by 1 or 2 goals.  That&#8217;s a lot of hard-scrabble 60 minute hockey, perfectly timed for this time of year.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16252" alt="kings blues" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/kings-blues.jpg" width="480" height="339" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/kings-blues.jpg 600w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/kings-blues-300x212.jpg 300w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/kings-blues-500x353.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></p>

<p>Landeskog is 19 year, 286 days old &#8211; 11 days <em>younger</em> that Captain Awkward Pockets who was 19 years, 297 days old when he was given the &#8220;C&#8221; waaaaaaaaaaaaay back in May 2007.</p>
<p>This move to make Landeskog the captain comes after Milan Hejduk announced that he was giving up his role as the Avalanche&#8217;s captain.  He will continue to serve as an alternate captain, along with Paul &#8220;Bang Bang Bang&#8221; Stastny.</p>
<p>Landeskog will be just the 4th captain in Avalanche history, the 11th captain in Avs/Nordiques history, and only the third European born player to serve as captain.</p>

<p>We adore his <a title="Swedish Meatball" href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/2012/08/15/swedish-meatball/">twitter</a> wikkid hahd corah.</p>
<p>And we lauded his feats of <a title="The Kid Stays in the Picture" href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/2012/03/13/the-kid-stays-in-the-picture/">super-human hockey strength</a>.</p>
<p>He possesses all the qualties that a future NHL superstar should have &#8211; talent, bucket loads of charisma, excellent camera presence, and a face that could launch a thousand ships.</p>
<p>We are card-carrying members of the Gabriel Landeskog fan club and today&#8217;s announcement makes us really happy.</p>
<p>Now if we can only sort out that whole NHL vs. NHLPA business&#8230;</p>

<p>Last night, the Kings went into <strong>full-on beast mode</strong> and beat the New Jersey Devils 6-1 to clinch the <strong>first Stanley Cup in the franchise&#8217;s 45 year history.</strong></p>
<p>This team, and their entire playoff run was epic &#8211; one of firsts, impressive records, and feats of altheticism and skill that make us super jealous.</p>
<p>The Kings <em>barely</em> made the playoffs and are the first ever eight-seed to win the Cup.  They did so with an impressive <strong>16-4 record</strong> and a unimaginable <strong>10-1 road record</strong>.</p>
<p>They rolled over the #1, #2, and #3 seeds in the Western Conference in dominating fashion and matched the second-fastest run to a Stanley Cup Championship in modern NHL history.</p>

<p>It was no surprise that <a title="Foxy Friday – Jonathan Quick!" href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2012/04/20/foxy-friday-jonathan-quick/"><strong>Jonathan Quick</strong></a> won the <a title="Foxy Friday: Conn Smythe Trophy" href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2012/06/08/foxy-friday-conn-smythe-trophy/">Conn Smythe Trophy</a> as playoff MVP.  Pretty sure his <strong>goals-against-average was like -4</strong> and he had a <strong>save percentage of eleventy billion.</strong>  (It was actually 1.41 GAA and .946 save percentage &#8211; both NHL records)</p>
<p>Quick also became the <strong>3rd American-born player</strong> to win the Conn Smythe.  Fellow goalie Tim Thomas won last year (like we could forget) and waaaay back in 1994 (when Quick was 8 years old), Brian Leetch from the NY Rangers won it.</p>
<p><em>Another little tidbit of trivia info &#8211; Leetch and Quick both went to school at Avon Old Farms in Connecticut and played in Hockey East (Leetch at Boston College, Quick at UMass Amherst).  Oh and Thomas went to University of Vermont &#8211; also a Hockey East school.  HOCKEY EAST REPRESENT!</em></p>

<p>The game itself had a <strong>intensity befitting a potential Stanley Cup cliniching game</strong> and there can be no doubt that its defining moment came in the first period when the Devils&#8217; Steve Bernier boarded Rob Scuderi.</p>
<p>Scuderi was left bloodied and bruised.</p>
<p>Bernier felt shame and was ejected, resulting in a five-minute power play for the Kings.</p>
<p>During that five minutes, the captain Dustin Brown, Jeff Carter, and Trevor Lewis each scored goals.  The Kings never looked back.</p>

<p>Brown also added two assists and became just the 2nd American-born captain to raise the Cup.  He managed to accomplish that which the Great One, Wayne Gretzky, could not do in his eight year tenure with the Kings.</p>
<p>Anze Kopitar has poised himself on the edge of NHL super stardom.  He tied for the playoff lead in points (20) and goals (8), and finished a ridiculous +16.  Not only is he the first Slovenian to play in the NHL, but now he&#8217;ll be the first ever to have his name engraved on the Cup.</p>
<p>He also is the first ever to wear this in a post-game interview.</p>

<p>This team was chockful of talent and size and skill and they peaked at the most perfect time.  Their regular season was inconsistent at best as they struggled to score goals, but something special happened after Darryl Sutter took over the team midseason.</p>
<p>So special in fact, that it earned them the most coveted and respected trophy in all of sports.</p>
<p>We are very much looking forward to the Kings&#8217; summer with the Cup and all the photos, tweets, and stories that will undoubtedly follow.</p>
<p>We want to see Dustin Penner eat some pancakes out of the Cup.</p>
<p>We want to Carter and Richards take the Cup on a sunset stroll on the beach.</p>
<p>But most of all, we want to see the players, and their family, friends, and fans, savor every moment of this incredible accomplishment.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><strong>CONGRATS to the 2012 Stanley Cup Champion, Los Angeles Kings!</strong></h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So Game 5 didn&#8217;t exactly turn out as we hoped, but tonight, the Kings have the chance to close out the series (again) and win their first ever Stanley Cup.</p>
<p>While we don&#8217;t like the Devils, we have to give them props for not laying down in front of the purple and black freight train and for pushing the series to a Game 6.</p>
<p>Last week, the Devils were down 3-0 in the series, teetering percariously on the edge, Jonathan Quick poised to send them tumbling into the abyss of the SCF sweep.</p>
<div style="width: 495px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" " src="http://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_606w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2012/06/07/Sports/Images/2012-06-07T042119Z_01_LOA301_RTRIDSP_3_NHL-STANLEY.jpg" alt="" width="485" height="310" /><p class="wp-caption-text">No goal for you.</p></div>
<p>But leave it to Marty Brodeur, the 4o year old future Hall of Fame netminder, to bring the Devils back and for the players like Parise, Salvador, and he of the creeper &#8216;stach, Henrique, to step up big time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/brodeur-martin-tounge-out.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-10982" title="brodeur, martin - tounge out" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/brodeur-martin-tounge-out.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="416" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/brodeur-martin-tounge-out.jpg 466w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/brodeur-martin-tounge-out-235x300.jpg 235w" sizes="(max-width: 326px) 100vw, 326px" /></a></p>
<p>Have the Devils totally messed with the Kings&#8217; hockey chi?  Will they come from 3-0 down to win their 4th Stanley Cup?</p>
<p>Mike Richards and his heterosexual life partner, Jeff Carter are determined to not make that happen.</p>
<p><strong>Their epic bromance will conquer all.</strong></p>
<div style="width: 255px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img style="border-style: none; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding: 0;" src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m51sa1VdNu1r38t7oo1_250.gif" alt="" width="245" height="140" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Most epic of bromances.</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">If there ever was a time that these two needed to step up, it is tonight.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Time to silence all those hater and critics and to show the Flyers fans what they could have had.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I have confidence in the Kings.  They just need to play the way that they&#8217;ve been playing the entire playoffs.  With physicality, skill, strength. But most importantly, to play like one being,  a hockey borg, if you will.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Take a deep breath, boys.  Keep calm and carry on.</p>

<p>Saturday night Drew Doughty went from an over-priced, cry-baby, cheese-burger eating hold out to a Rocket Man shooting lazers out his ass and smacking Devils like he was at a carnival and Brown was taunting him with a donut for each one he could take out!<br />

Even though each game has gone into OT, the LA KINGS have shown they can re-group when it matters and pull it out. For the GW – it was Pancakes for the block on Brodeur and Carter came in on the blocker side. You totally know Richards and Carter made sweet love on the 6 hour flight back to Los Angeles and ravaged the mini bar to boot!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Kings devastated the Coyotes last night in more ways than one. The Coyotes bit back and not in a nice way. I was going to take the high road in this post and talk about how adorable Antoine Vermette was in his pre-game interview but then the Coyotes took a page from the Penguin’s book of Poor Sports and all this happened:</p>
<p>Shane Doan takes Trevor Lewis’ face for a wipe board. OK-  he did turn but a delayed penalty had already been called for slashing on BROWN so all Doan needed to do was reach for the puck – not take Lewis’ face for a ride. He got thrown out which was appropriate – IN MY OPINION.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/4sR2gyenWWE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Mike Smith slashes Dustin Brown in the back of the knees. They get MATCHING penalties because the ref thinks Brown is embellishing – HELLO! <strong>Anyone who gets the craps smacked out of the back of their knees with a goalie stick by a 6’3” MONSTER isn’t embellishing ANYTHING.</strong></p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/FaFNNfFDjhw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p><strong>As one commentator said, “If that was acting, it’s some of the best to come out of Hollywood in years!”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Then Hanzal decides ride Brown into the boards like a whore on Saturday night. </strong>Fellas, I get it, you’re frustrated. You got your asses handed to you by an 8<sup>th</sup> seed team for a second night. But this is<strong> UNACCEPTABLE. </strong></p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/LEts7wF4iMg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Then – my favorite of the night – Dustin “Pancakes” Penner decides enough is enough and when a scrum breaks out to quell it, he just sits on Antoine Vermette. Awesomesauce. Nothing says shut your face like a 6’ 4” manbeast sitting on your lame ass.</p>
<p><strong>Oh did I mention that Jeff Carter, man of the hour, got a natural hat trick? The first one for the Kings in the play-offs since  &#8211; oh – Wayne Gretzky in 1993? Yeah … that happen too last night!</strong></p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/9v-aLVvN_GU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a few days after something bad happens, you don&#8217;t want to be cheered up.  You want to drown in a cocktail shaker or eat an entire wedding cake.  If you&#8217;re me, you picked a bright orange heavy bag and kickboxed the crap out of it a la Captain America.</p>
<p>Then life goes on.  Other teams win and lose, and to keep me from slipping out of reach after last night&#8217;s Blackhawks loss, I need a moment to thank the Penguins for a great season.</p>
<div id="attachment_10248" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/pens-team-photo.jpg">

	</a><p class="wp-caption-text">Prom Night 2012. They obviously tried to take the photo before Letang showed up, but no such luck. The man even looks good in a ponytail.</p></div>
<p>The waiting was the hardest part.   I held my breath a lot, exhaling mostly in the form of cheers for for Malkin and Neal and all those beautiful points.  When Crosby was finally back for good, all I could do was sigh.</p>
<p>At the end, the Penguins went a little haywire.  Their top-of-the-line hardware should run like a fighter jet, but somewhere in the programming the machine became human.  Their system fell apart in the first three games vs. Philly and couldn&#8217;t recover.  But like the computer you&#8217;re on right now, you don&#8217;t throw it away when it malfunctions.  You smack it and threaten to chuck it out the window, but really you just shut down, wait a minute and reboot.</p>
<p>Or you go on summer vacation.</p>

<p>To send the Pens off, here are a few things we demand to see this summer.</p>
<p><strong>We Want: James Neal in Glasses</strong></p>
<p>Nealmobile once came a contact lense away from a career-ending eye injury [<a href="http://www.defendingbigd.com/2009/4/30/860171/world-championships-update-james">link</a>].  He could have been finger painting like Doug Dorsey!  Thank God for small miracles.  Where there are contacts, there are glasses, and some super sleuth found them in NHL36:</p>

	</a></p>
<p>The old adage &#8220;boys don&#8217;t make passes at girls who wear glasses&#8221; is not at all true for girls.  We LOVE your glasses (without ever seeing you wear them).  In fact, <strong>how dare you deprive us?</strong>  Mike Green would never do that.  Since it&#8217;s only April and you&#8217;re gone, at least give us this.</p>
<p><strong>We Want: Geno&#8217;s T-Shirt Collection</strong></p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t get enough hilarity out of Geno&#8217;s wardrobe this year.  The man alternately shops at Charlotte Russe and the Hustler Store, which can only mean one thing: we can&#8217;t wait to see what he&#8217;s wearing at the high-roller table in Vegas when he picks up that Hart Trophy.</p>

<p><strong>We Want: Niskanen and Sullivan</strong></p>
<p>Matt Niskanen&#8217;s (RFA) middle name is Norman for heaven&#8217;s sake.  Sullivan (UFA) fits in on any line and plays like he&#8217;s in his twenties.  Sign them now.</p>

			</span>
		</span>
	</a></p>
<p><strong>We Want: Workout Videos</strong></p>
<p>Show us how hard you&#8217;re working, how dedicated you are to the new season.  That&#8217;s what these videos are about, right?  Last year we posted Kris Letang&#8217;s [<a href="http://video.penguins.nhl.com/videocenter/console?id=122151">link</a>] and you guys all disappeared for a week.  Maybe this year, James Neal won&#8217;t be ignored in the Camp Biosteel videos.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/JIWpYbUSXhs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>I think that&#8217;s everything we need for the next five months.  Players eat their Wheaties and do their squats while we save up cash for tickets and merch.  See you all in Septemb&#8230;  hahahaha.  RIGHT.</p>
<p><strong>We Want:</strong></p>

<p>The Caps picked it up last night vs. Minnesota with a 3-0 win and <strong>reclaimed the 8th spot</strong>.  I&#8217;m willing to temporarily un-hate Ovi if he comes to play everyday.  Even Sasha Fierce downloaded new software from the Matrix and remembered he plays for, not against, the Capitals.  Everybody happy, right?</p>

<p>Wrong.  Among the NBS Sports 2nd intermission discussion topics was &#8220;Mike Green&#8217;s Regression.&#8221;  They noted Mike&#8217;s struggles since returning, including how the Caps won the first 8 games Mike played in, but have gone some low number-for-some high number since his return.  <strong>Oh yes, BLAME MIKE GREEN.  It&#8217;s all his fault.</strong>  The talking heads agreed that with &#8220;the way Mike Green is playing, I&#8217;d be licking my chops to face to Capitals in the first round.&#8221;</p>

<p>True, Mike hasn&#8217;t been in top form.  He hasn&#8217;t scored a goal.  Last night he tried to pass to me, in Maryland, and iced the puck for no reason.  But <strong>no one gets to make fun of Mike Green except for us</strong>, because we do it out of love. Sometimes Mike does dumb things &#8211; he did them when he got two Norris nominations.   The Caps have been struggling all season, where were you morons?   I had some choice words for Milbury last night, I think my neighbors earmuffed their kids.</p>

<p>That said,<strong> I&#8217;m done defending the players on this team</strong>.  I&#8217;ve kept my mouth mostly shut (except to Gator) all season and tried to stay positive.  I don&#8217;t care if the defense pairings are painfully awkward.  This is the time.  Ovechkin has his sparkle back, maybe Semin too.  We&#8217;ve been waiting all damned season for that, so take the opportunity while there&#8217;s still some gas in the tank.  You might get Nicky back.  You might elect Jason Chimera as your tribute from the District.  <strong>You might even make the playoffs.</strong>  So let&#8217;s go!</p>

<p>When I have the flu, all I want to do is eat saltines, drink ginger ale, and watch bad movies like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIclPmde1hM&amp;feature=fvst">&#8220;Teen Witch&#8221;</a>.  The thought of having to play 60 minutes of hockey when all you want to do is hurl makes me want to hurl.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how you did it, kid.</p>
<p>Landeskog also had three shots in the game bringing his season tally to 235 for the year, <strong>breaking Peter Stasny&#8217;s franchise rookie record</strong> for shots set waaaaay back in 1980-81 (12 years before GL92 was even a fetus.)</p>
<p>The Avalanche are in a desperate fight for a playoff spot so they are gonna need every point they can get.  Last night&#8217;s win moved them into 8th in the Western Conference.</p>

<p>With Matt Duchene out with a ankle injury, the Avs are going to have to depend guys like Landeskog, O&#8217;Reilly, and Stasny to keep them in the hunt.  Also critical to their playoffs hopes is the goaltending of Varlamov.  He&#8217;s been playing really well as of late and last night, he looked pretty tioght.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s hope that the Avs&#8217; young talent can sustain them and keep them in the race.</p>
<p>Because frankly, we&#8217;d love to see more of this.</p>

<p><em>P.S.  Kudos to Landeskog for giving a very nice, poised, coherent post-game interview.  So often, I cringe every time players do post-games because 99% of them are in desperate need of media training.  <strong>But Gabe was perfect</strong>.  Kid is gonna be a superstar.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MAYDAY! MAYDAY!</p>
<p>Help!</p>
<p>The<strong> Bruins are teetering precariously on the edge</strong> of the abyss&#8230;and they are threathening to take me with them.</p>
<p>Saturday, they lost to the Capitals.  Yesterday, they got violated by the Penguins.  <strong>Patrice Bergeron and Adam McQuaid both got injured</strong>.  With Nathan Horton, Rich Peverley, Beniot Pouliot, and Tuukka Rask already out, it only to the dire situation the Black and Gold find themselves in late in the season.</p>
<p><strong>Can I get a prayer circle?</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_9601" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/bergeron-patrice-sad-face.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9601 " title="Bergeron, Patrice - sad face" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/bergeron-patrice-sad-face.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="312" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/bergeron-patrice-sad-face.jpg 493w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/bergeron-patrice-sad-face-300x191.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Never have I seen a sadder face. Never.</p></div>
<p>McQuaid took a hard hit from James Neal in the 1st and did not return for rest of the game.  Bergeron took a shot off the leg and labored badly to try to battle through, but did not return.</p>
<p>Obviously, <strong>goaltending is a SERIOUS issue</strong> for the Bruins.  Serio, people.  I knew losing Tuukka would be tough but I had not fully realize it until this weekend.</p>
<p>And when I did, <strong>this was me.</strong></p>

<p>Luckily I managed to pull myself together and attempted to analyze this mess of a situation the Bruins are in.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, Tukkaa would have played Saturday&#8217;s matinee versus the Caps, allowing Thomas to rest up for the game against the Pens.  But with Rask recovering from a groin injury, the <strong>Bruins were up Crap Creek without a paddle.  </strong></p>
<p>Hell, they didn&#8217;t even have a boat.</p>
<p>Then you add in the clocks springing forward for daylight savings, and  you have a <strong>recipe for a grade A+, #1 disaster of epic proportion</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Yesterday&#8217;s game was that unmitigated disaster.</strong></p>
<p>The Pens jumped all over Thomas from the first whistle scoring 3 goals in the first.  It was ooglay.</p>
<p>I was <strong>ready to rage every time the Penguins touched the puck</strong> out of sheer frustration.</p>

<p>Normally, I have no issues with the Penguins.  While they are not my favorite team, I respect them and like alot of their players but yesterday, <strong>I want to kick all of them in the shins.</strong></p>
<p>Like really hard.</p>
<p>Bruins managed to stauch the bleeding somewhat at the beginning of the 2nd period by pulling Thomas and putting in Marty Turco.  TURCO TIME, YA&#8217;LL!</p>
<p>Turco played well in his first NHL game in over a year and <a href="http://www.nesn.com/2012/03/marty-turco-admits-austrian-fans-threw-dead-fish-at-him-during-his-ec-red-bull-salzburg-days.html">no one threw smelly fish at him</a>.  He only allowed 2 goals (if that can be considered a postitive) and made some great saves, including this gem on JStaal.</p>
<!--YouTube Error: bad URL entered-->
<p><strong>Poke Check.  Stack the pads.</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how it could get any worse for the Bruins but if they hope to have any chance to make a run for defending their Stanley Cup, they need to do something.</p>
<p>I have a suggestion.</p>
<p><strong>Bubble wrap.</strong></p>
<p>And lots of it.</p>
<p>Call Mike Green.  I&#8217;m sure he has some extra lying about.</p>

<p>I perish the thought but the harsh reality is that it could happen. <strong> But I don&#8217;t wants it to happen!  </strong></p>
<p>With every fiber of my body I want Savvy to <strong>come back in October</strong> refresh, ready, and symptom-free to take his place with the Stanley Cup Champion Boston Bruins.</p>
<p>But I just don&#8217;t know if that is going to happen.  And that makes me one sad panda.</p>
<p><strong>Pants knows how I&#8217;m feeling about all this.</strong>  She&#8217;s patiently waiting for Sidney to recover, leave the comfy confines of Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia and make his way back to da &#8216;Burgh and the love fest that is the Pittsburgh Penguins organization.</p>

<p>Until then, we&#8217;ll just wait all night&#8230;by this hedge&#8230;</p>
