				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Of the Staples Center&#8221;</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Kings will FINALLY get to raise their Stanley Cup banner tonight and WUYS West Coast Correspondent, Aaron is hella excited about it.</p>
<p>Check out his post below&#8230;</p>
<hr />
<p>So here we stand, about to embark on a far too short, forty-eight game NHL season.</p>
<p>Man, it sucks to get short-shrifted on our hockey this year, but I’d be lying if I didn’t say that raising a certain piece of synthetic fabric to the rafters of Staples Center wasn’t going to soften the blow.</p>
<p>On Saturday, January 19<sup>th</sup> at 12 p.m. on the “best” coast (sorry Chuck &amp; Pants), the Los Angeles Kings will raise their first “Stanley Cup Champions” banner in their forty-four year franchise’s history. Worth. Every. Agonizing. Moment.</p>

<p>I’ve seen it all as a Kings fan.</p>
<p>And having witnessed the good, bad, and the oh-so-very ugly of being a Kings fan over the last twenty-five years, it’ll all be worth it, watching that banner get raised, tears streaming down my face like a toddler with a skinned knee.</p>
<p>That’s okay though, I will sob proudly, because this isn’t a moment you get to experience very often.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that the Kings organization chose not to mount the banner on the wall of the Staples Center, because, well, a certain NBA team was kind of hogging it.</p>
<p>

<p>So instead, the banner will be the first to actually hang from the rafters of Staples, which symbolizes more than a lack of real estate on the wall.</p>
<p>It symbolizes that Tim Lieweke and the Kings organization want to leave plenty of room for future banners. Lieweke and GM Dean Lombardi built this team from the ground up with the hope of not winning one Stanley Cup, but creating a dynasty.</p>

<p>Seems like a smooth transition into the Kings chances of repeating. Now, it’s no secret there hasn’t been a team to repeat as Stanley Cup champions for fifteen years [1998 Detroit Red Wings.] Bottom line, it’s hard as hell to repeat.</p>
<p>But, and at the risk of sounding like a total “homer,” I think the Kings are poised to be the first team break the fifteen year drought.</p>
<p>Everyone is quick to point out the infamous Stanley Cup hangover – where the team that won the Cup struggles the following season do to an exhausting schedule of parading the Cup around all summer all the while trying to recover from injuries sustained during the elongated playoff run.</p>
<p>Well, considering the Kings have had an extra few months to recuperate, it’s like they ordered Grey Goose instead of the well crap and will wake up on opening day with no headache or vomiting, ready for the puck to drop.</p>

<p>The Kings are also the first team in recent memory to bring back their entire Stanley Cup winning roster.</p>
<p>Lucky for the Kings, there were no aging veterans, no pending free agents looking to get overpaid, and no fat to trim.</p>
<p>Being able to maintain that same chemistry and not having to learn to gel with new teammates is huge advantage for a team looking to repeat as Cup champs.</p>
<p>I’m not calling my shot, just saying that the Kings have a better shot than teams in recent past.</p>
<p>Finally, as the various sports news outlets put out their preseason team rankings, TSN has the Kings ranked at number ten.</p>

<p>My initial feeling upon reading that was <strong>blasphemy</strong>.</p>
<p>After all, how could you possibly rank <strong>nine teams above</strong> the Stanley Cup winners?</p>
<p>After I stopped my combination of yelling and crying however, I realized that this is right where the Kings want to be.</p>
<p>Flying under the radar, no expectations, doing just well enough to hang around.</p>
<p>The Kings are basically the “According to Jim” of the regular season.</p>
<p>But without sucking.</p>
<p>Let’s do it again, boys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GO KINGS GO!</p>

<p>First he took me on a romantic tracker drive, just us and the cup after we picked it from the local airport. Love the rolled up jeans and tennies. Totes dreamy!</p>

<p> Then we took in a showing of an interpretive dance, &#8220;How Oxmusk bay in mid-day in yonder meadow&#8221;. It was fabulous but honestly, I spent most of the time glaring at the cup because it was starting to seriously come between Drew and I. I mean really! Who does that whore think she is? I&#8230; I .. ah. Oh. Yeah. It&#8217;s THE CUP.</p>
<p>Well, I did get jealous because bitch pulled this move at dinner and the gloves came off!</p>

<p> So my drunk ugly crying face came out like the girls on Bachelor pad because a girl just can&#8217;t complete between THE CUP and Stanley Cup winning hockey players attention on his big day. So I wished Drew the best and left him with his shiny toy.</p>

<p>Let me start off by saying it’s a good thing this isn’t a vlog otherwise you’d be watching me <strong>fill my playoff beard with tears of joy</strong>.</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to know about me&#8230;</p>
<p>My name is Aaron Vaccaro.  I am a Los Angeles Kings fan. I’ve been a Los Angeles Kings fan for twenty-five of my twenty-nine years on this Earth.</p>
<div id="attachment_11002" style="width: 402px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/556609_10101630165547007_2046450276_n.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-11002 " title="556609_10101630165547007_2046450276_n" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/556609_10101630165547007_2046450276_n.jpg" alt="" width="392" height="525" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/556609_10101630165547007_2046450276_n.jpg 716w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/556609_10101630165547007_2046450276_n-223x300.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Baby Aaron. Just as cute as Baby Toews.</p></div>
<p>Being a Kings fan has been a rough road. <strong>A <span style="text-decoration:underline;">very</span> rough road</strong>. The kind of road you only expect to encounter in a third world country.</p>
<p>But none of that matters anymore. Because as I write this, the Kings have been Stanley Cup champions for just over twenty-four hours and I’ve had a case of goose bumps for just as long.</p>
<p>For those who have been living under a rock for the last two months, you unfortunately missed one of the most historical runs by any NHL team ever.</p>
<p>I could give you all of the record-setting facts and figures, but Chuck and Pants didn’t ask me to do a guest post to bore you with that kind of stuff. They instead asked me to try to convey what it feels like to be a Kings fan right now… Well, I’ll tell you… <strong>it’s amazing.</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_11004" style="width: 402px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/564356_10150983551250901_22687694_n.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-11004" title="564356_10150983551250901_22687694_n" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/564356_10150983551250901_22687694_n.jpg" alt="" width="392" height="525" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/564356_10150983551250901_22687694_n.jpg 717w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/564356_10150983551250901_22687694_n-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Aaron is all his hockey glory.</p></div>
<p>This has been a rollercoaster of a year for us fans as much as it was for the team itself. We came into the season with high expectations only to have them all but dashed by December, which unfortunately was not unfamiliar territory for Kings fans.</p>
<p>We all <strong>started to drink a lot heavier, </strong>thinking it was another season where we’d be on the outside looking in as some other team would taste the glory that we’d never gotten to taste.</p>
<p>But then the tide started to turn after a coaching change was made, a trade deadline acquisition brought Jeff Carter to the team, and everything started to click. The Kings managed to squeak into the playoffs and the “<strong>Team of Destiny” train left the station bound for eternal glory.</strong></p>

<p>Was I at the game? No. Mainly because I’m not a celebrity, agent, doctor, lawyer, or fan willing to sell off the rights to their first born.</p>
<p>Okay, to be honest, I would’ve sold off the rights to my first-born if that was acceptable tender.</p>
<p>Do I wish I could’ve been at the game? Of course. That’s a dumb question, and I’m mad I even asked myself that.</p>
<p>But alas, I was instead relegated to watching the game at our local dive bar. But this wasn’t just any dive. Sure, they have <strong>PBR on tap, and a mean plate of onion rings</strong>, but they were also filled with wall-to-wall Kings fans making it the <strong>best dive bar in Los Angeles</strong> as far as I was concerned.</p>
<p>We were surrounded by other fellow fans that had spent years bleeding black, silver, white, purple, gold (okay, so we’ve had a lot of different jersey colors…)</p>
<p>There was lots of drinking, cheering, high-fiving, and <strong>bearded men hugging complete strangers, most of which were also bearded men</strong>.  It was a truly beautiful site.</p>

<p>Up until two months ago, I was used to getting this question: “You’re a Kings fan? Why?”</p>
<p>My answer &#8211; &#8220;We don’t choose the teams we want to be fans of.  <strong>They choose us.</strong>&#8221;</p>
<p>They captivate us, enthrall us, and make us realize we’ll do whatever it takes (including murdering a hobo) if that means we would get the chance to see that team win a championship. And believe me, I was close to committing homicide.</p>
<p>People don’t realize what it was like for us to watch the Anaheim Ducks win the Stanley Cup back in 2007.</p>
<p>I’ll tell you what it was like&#8230;<strong>utterly humiliating</strong>.</p>
<p>Not only did we have to watch a team based on Emilio Estevez movie win our trophy, but we also had to watch them do it in only fourteen seasons of existence. For those of you counting at home, it took the Kings thirty one years longer. Compound onto that every Ducks fan reminding us of this fact for the past five years and you could probably taste our pain and sorrow.</p>
<p>But that all ended last night. We will know longer be ridiculed. We’re once again the only team that matters in Southern California.</p>

<p>Los Angeles is a town that isn’t considered to have much of an identity. Geographically spread out, it’s easy to think there is no unity in this city. Hell, I even questioned it for a period of time. But these last few weeks, I’ve never felt closer to my fellow Angelenos. Sure, you can scoff and say, “Well, those are just bandwagoners. They’re not <span style="text-decoration:underline;">real</span> fans.” You’re right. They probably are just bandwagoners. But who cares?! It’s people paying attention to hockey in a town where all the AM sports talk radio is completely dominated by Lakers, Clippers, and Dodgers. Don’t worry, there’s plenty of room on the bandwagon for all of you. People accuse Los Angeles of simply just “loving a winner.” Hell yeah we do. Every town loves a winner. Tell me a town that hates to see their teams win and <strong>I promise to streak naked through Downtown L.A. in nothing but my Stanley Cup champion hat.</strong></p>

<p>Last night, the Kings went into <strong>full-on beast mode</strong> and beat the New Jersey Devils 6-1 to clinch the <strong>first Stanley Cup in the franchise&#8217;s 45 year history.</strong></p>
<p>This team, and their entire playoff run was epic &#8211; one of firsts, impressive records, and feats of altheticism and skill that make us super jealous.</p>
<p>The Kings <em>barely</em> made the playoffs and are the first ever eight-seed to win the Cup.  They did so with an impressive <strong>16-4 record</strong> and a unimaginable <strong>10-1 road record</strong>.</p>
<p>They rolled over the #1, #2, and #3 seeds in the Western Conference in dominating fashion and matched the second-fastest run to a Stanley Cup Championship in modern NHL history.</p>

<p>It was no surprise that <a title="Foxy Friday – Jonathan Quick!" href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2012/04/20/foxy-friday-jonathan-quick/"><strong>Jonathan Quick</strong></a> won the <a title="Foxy Friday: Conn Smythe Trophy" href="http://whatsupyasieve.com/2012/06/08/foxy-friday-conn-smythe-trophy/">Conn Smythe Trophy</a> as playoff MVP.  Pretty sure his <strong>goals-against-average was like -4</strong> and he had a <strong>save percentage of eleventy billion.</strong>  (It was actually 1.41 GAA and .946 save percentage &#8211; both NHL records)</p>
<p>Quick also became the <strong>3rd American-born player</strong> to win the Conn Smythe.  Fellow goalie Tim Thomas won last year (like we could forget) and waaaay back in 1994 (when Quick was 8 years old), Brian Leetch from the NY Rangers won it.</p>
<p><em>Another little tidbit of trivia info &#8211; Leetch and Quick both went to school at Avon Old Farms in Connecticut and played in Hockey East (Leetch at Boston College, Quick at UMass Amherst).  Oh and Thomas went to University of Vermont &#8211; also a Hockey East school.  HOCKEY EAST REPRESENT!</em></p>

<p>The game itself had a <strong>intensity befitting a potential Stanley Cup cliniching game</strong> and there can be no doubt that its defining moment came in the first period when the Devils&#8217; Steve Bernier boarded Rob Scuderi.</p>
<p>Scuderi was left bloodied and bruised.</p>
<p>Bernier felt shame and was ejected, resulting in a five-minute power play for the Kings.</p>
<p>During that five minutes, the captain Dustin Brown, Jeff Carter, and Trevor Lewis each scored goals.  The Kings never looked back.</p>

<p>Brown also added two assists and became just the 2nd American-born captain to raise the Cup.  He managed to accomplish that which the Great One, Wayne Gretzky, could not do in his eight year tenure with the Kings.</p>
<p>Anze Kopitar has poised himself on the edge of NHL super stardom.  He tied for the playoff lead in points (20) and goals (8), and finished a ridiculous +16.  Not only is he the first Slovenian to play in the NHL, but now he&#8217;ll be the first ever to have his name engraved on the Cup.</p>
<p>He also is the first ever to wear this in a post-game interview.</p>

<p>This team was chockful of talent and size and skill and they peaked at the most perfect time.  Their regular season was inconsistent at best as they struggled to score goals, but something special happened after Darryl Sutter took over the team midseason.</p>
<p>So special in fact, that it earned them the most coveted and respected trophy in all of sports.</p>
<p>We are very much looking forward to the Kings&#8217; summer with the Cup and all the photos, tweets, and stories that will undoubtedly follow.</p>
<p>We want to see Dustin Penner eat some pancakes out of the Cup.</p>
<p>We want to Carter and Richards take the Cup on a sunset stroll on the beach.</p>
<p>But most of all, we want to see the players, and their family, friends, and fans, savor every moment of this incredible accomplishment.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><strong>CONGRATS to the 2012 Stanley Cup Champion, Los Angeles Kings!</strong></h3>

<p>The President spoke for a bit, chided the city of Boston for having too many championship teams, called out Brad Marchand (&#8220;Little Ball of Hate?  What&#8217;s up with that nickname?&#8221;), and posed with the team for the obligatory photo shoot. <em>Watch the full video<a href="http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=espn:7493886"> [here].</a></em></p>
<p>Notably absent from today&#8217;s festivities was goaltender <strong>Tim Thomas</strong>, one of only two Americans on the team.  Apparently, Timmeh is a stauch conservative and refused the invite from the Commander in Chief due to &#8220;political reasons.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Thomas is absolutely entitled to his beliefs and can choose do to what he wants (this is a free country, after all),  <strong>wouldn&#8217;t you want to go just to share the experience with your teammates&#8230;and steal pens and hand towels from White House?  </strong></p>
<p>Eh, whatever. I&#8217;m over it.</p>
<p>As long as Timmy keeps making saves and playing like a boss, I don&#8217;t really care whether or not he likes the President.</p>
