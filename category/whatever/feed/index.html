<p>Booing?  Really?  Why is that even necessary? I lovelove<strong>LOVE</strong> the Bruins but sometimes their fans are just exceptionally ridculous.</p>
<p>In case you&#8217;ve forgotten, Seguin and Peverely didn&#8217;t ASK to be traded from Boston.  Their departure from Boston was a product of salary caps and business strategies.</p>
<p>Now, I don&#8217;t pretend that Seguin is some perfect, sacrosanct hockey player.  He made personal and professional mistakes that didn&#8217;t help his cause and contributed to the ease of his departure, but Peverely &#8211; Really, people?  What did Rich Peverley ever do to deserve your ire?</p>

<p>For all those people who vilified them last night, how quickly you have forgotten these two were are part of the team that brought the Stanley Cup to Boston for the first time in almost 40 years.  How quickly you have forgotten that #19 sweater that you so eagerly purchased proudly declaring your status as a Seguinista.</p>

<p>Well last night&#8217;s shootout was just for you then.  You know that all your booing and chanting and general turpitude just made Seguin and Peverely even more determined to shut you up.  And they did.  So good on ya. WTG.</p>
<p>Now they hate us and never want to come back here and it is all your fault.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MAYDAY! MAYDAY!</p>
<p>Help!</p>
<p>The<strong> Bruins are teetering precariously on the edge</strong> of the abyss&#8230;and they are threathening to take me with them.</p>
<p>Saturday, they lost to the Capitals.  Yesterday, they got violated by the Penguins.  <strong>Patrice Bergeron and Adam McQuaid both got injured</strong>.  With Nathan Horton, Rich Peverley, Beniot Pouliot, and Tuukka Rask already out, it only to the dire situation the Black and Gold find themselves in late in the season.</p>
<p><strong>Can I get a prayer circle?</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_9601" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/bergeron-patrice-sad-face.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9601 " title="Bergeron, Patrice - sad face" src="http://wuys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/bergeron-patrice-sad-face.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="312" srcset="http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/bergeron-patrice-sad-face.jpg 493w, http://whatsupyasieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/bergeron-patrice-sad-face-300x191.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Never have I seen a sadder face. Never.</p></div>
<p>McQuaid took a hard hit from James Neal in the 1st and did not return for rest of the game.  Bergeron took a shot off the leg and labored badly to try to battle through, but did not return.</p>
<p>Obviously, <strong>goaltending is a SERIOUS issue</strong> for the Bruins.  Serio, people.  I knew losing Tuukka would be tough but I had not fully realize it until this weekend.</p>
<p>And when I did, <strong>this was me.</strong></p>

<p>Luckily I managed to pull myself together and attempted to analyze this mess of a situation the Bruins are in.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, Tukkaa would have played Saturday&#8217;s matinee versus the Caps, allowing Thomas to rest up for the game against the Pens.  But with Rask recovering from a groin injury, the <strong>Bruins were up Crap Creek without a paddle.  </strong></p>
<p>Hell, they didn&#8217;t even have a boat.</p>
<p>Then you add in the clocks springing forward for daylight savings, and  you have a <strong>recipe for a grade A+, #1 disaster of epic proportion</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Yesterday&#8217;s game was that unmitigated disaster.</strong></p>
<p>The Pens jumped all over Thomas from the first whistle scoring 3 goals in the first.  It was ooglay.</p>
<p>I was <strong>ready to rage every time the Penguins touched the puck</strong> out of sheer frustration.</p>

<p>Normally, I have no issues with the Penguins.  While they are not my favorite team, I respect them and like alot of their players but yesterday, <strong>I want to kick all of them in the shins.</strong></p>
<p>Like really hard.</p>
<p>Bruins managed to stauch the bleeding somewhat at the beginning of the 2nd period by pulling Thomas and putting in Marty Turco.  TURCO TIME, YA&#8217;LL!</p>
<p>Turco played well in his first NHL game in over a year and <a href="http://www.nesn.com/2012/03/marty-turco-admits-austrian-fans-threw-dead-fish-at-him-during-his-ec-red-bull-salzburg-days.html">no one threw smelly fish at him</a>.  He only allowed 2 goals (if that can be considered a postitive) and made some great saves, including this gem on JStaal.</p>
<!--YouTube Error: bad URL entered-->
<p><strong>Poke Check.  Stack the pads.</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how it could get any worse for the Bruins but if they hope to have any chance to make a run for defending their Stanley Cup, they need to do something.</p>
<p>I have a suggestion.</p>
<p><strong>Bubble wrap.</strong></p>
<p>And lots of it.</p>
<p>Call Mike Green.  I&#8217;m sure he has some extra lying about.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I simply have to vent this and get it off my, ah, proverbial chest ladies. As the resident Ovi fan and Captials fan, I know this will come as shock, but I AM SO MAD AT HIM, at them, at the WORLD and have been for some time and I just have to say and get it out.</p>
<p>An open letter to Mr. Leonsis,</p>
<p>I say this with as a fan of Alexander Ovechkin, first and foremost, and then of hockey.  <strong>When you fired Bruce Boudreau, a little piece of me died</strong> because no matter how the mainstream media spun it, we all know that it was because of player issues – e.g. Ovechkin.</p>
<p>Boudreau is a great coach. He will probably be the best coach you will ever have. He was not the problem. We all know “What the problem is with the Washington Capitals.” The real question is what is going to be done about it?</p>
<p>For five years I’ve watched Ovechkin go from a great player to a player with a great attitude. It pains me to say that but having been an athlete myself on a team, and a captain as well; you have to lead by example.  </p>
<p>I had hoped Mr. Leonsis would have bucked the system and shook things up by NOT firing Boudreau, showing some loyalty, having some balls, and fixing the real problem. If he had, his team may have actually had a shot at the play-offs. <strong>Sometimes the Alpha dog needs a good swat to the nutsack to get back in line and lead the pack.</strong></p>
<p>But as it stands, the fans have watched Boudreau excel in Anaheim, their beloved team implode under the tutelage of Dale Hunter’s mess and Ovi still stands around on defense, stands around on offense, waits for his teammates to pass the puck to him and still misses it when they do. His attitude that he has to do it all has got to stop because guess what? He can’t, he certainly doesn’t and there are guys out there who can and are doing it better now.</p>
<p>He still has time on his contract where he can be traded. Perhaps before you fired Boudreau you should have used that bargaining chip to get your Alpha dog back in line. <strong>Now he’s the Rick Nash of the East Coast.</strong> No one will want that bad golden apple, no matter how good it might taste. <strong>He’s still too costly, you don’t know how he’ll perform and there still might be a worm in there somewhere. </strong>It&#8217;s not an imponderable conundrum. It&#8217;s just a conundrum.</p>
<p><strong>FIX IT. PLEASE.</strong></p>
<p> Missing BB,</p>
<p><strong>DC</strong></p>

<p>The President spoke for a bit, chided the city of Boston for having too many championship teams, called out Brad Marchand (&#8220;Little Ball of Hate?  What&#8217;s up with that nickname?&#8221;), and posed with the team for the obligatory photo shoot. <em>Watch the full video<a href="http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=espn:7493886"> [here].</a></em></p>
<p>Notably absent from today&#8217;s festivities was goaltender <strong>Tim Thomas</strong>, one of only two Americans on the team.  Apparently, Timmeh is a stauch conservative and refused the invite from the Commander in Chief due to &#8220;political reasons.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Thomas is absolutely entitled to his beliefs and can choose do to what he wants (this is a free country, after all),  <strong>wouldn&#8217;t you want to go just to share the experience with your teammates&#8230;and steal pens and hand towels from White House?  </strong></p>
<p>Eh, whatever. I&#8217;m over it.</p>
<p>As long as Timmy keeps making saves and playing like a boss, I don&#8217;t really care whether or not he likes the President.</p>
