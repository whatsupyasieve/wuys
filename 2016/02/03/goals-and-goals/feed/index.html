		<description><![CDATA[Count me in as a member of #TeamEggBaby! Whatta goal, man!!!

And, uh, yeah....that clip of Hot Crosberry Buns is LIFE! ; )

Another SUPER cute baby can be found on my friend Dawn&#039;s tweeter (@LadyTennisBall). She&#039;s a huge Ducks fan &#038; STH since they&#039;ve been a franchise. She has a grandson named Bodhi who is precious and she recently had Bobby Ryan sign a little, bitty bright yellow sweatshirt for him! I call Bodhi #BabyTennisBall now. Hahahaha]]></description>
