		<description><![CDATA[As soon as I saw that Jonathan Toews created a twitter account, I was laughing for 10 minutes straight. My mom thought something was seriously wrong with me. I mean I saw his 1st tweet, it was so unbelievably him. Perfect amount of dork, adorable and Jonathan Toews. Love the Toews-Shaw banter. SId&#039;s butt looks amazing in that picture. Nice one! I need to catch up on In the Room. Looking at Sid, Dumoulin and Flower all tanned *Cue TSwizzle&#039;s WIldest Dreams*]]></description>
