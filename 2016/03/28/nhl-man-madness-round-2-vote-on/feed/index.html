		<description><![CDATA[Carey Price!  I really do love him, and you can blame this moment: https://youtu.be/6Vowz2fG4_A (Low-quality video, high-quality feels!)

Are we thinking that eventually Jamie and Tyler will have to compete against one another?  (Jamie!  Jamie forever and ever.)]]></description>
