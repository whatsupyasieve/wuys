		<description><![CDATA[Sometimes I hate this stupid game. And that time is now, with the whole John Scott saga. The only consolation is fans TROLLING the NHL, buying up everything with &quot;Scott&quot; on it. Take that, f*ckers!

Also, my brain couldn&#039;t get past:

- 10 Things Sid Can Do Instead of the ASG - POST THIS NOW PLEASE
- Steven hasn&#039;t been a Foxy Friday?? I mean with all the love you give him, he hasn&#039;t been hurting for attention but still...my birthday&#039;s coming up. NOT on a Friday (Thursday), but I&#039;m just sayin&#039; ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would LOVE to see all the players have &quot;Scott&quot; on the back of their jerseys!!! Ahem - our Pens&#039; Equipment Staff under the supervision of Dana Heinze are taking care of the Eastern Conference boys, so maybe we have an in?!?!?  Those babies (all 4 of them!) will be VERY proud of their papa for his determination and standing up to the bullying of his bosses - as well they should be!!! Not a fan of his style of hockey, but i AM a fan of John Scott the MAN!]]></description>
