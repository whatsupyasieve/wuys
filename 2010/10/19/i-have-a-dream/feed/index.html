		<description><![CDATA[DAWN!  You did not appropriately tag this post as &quot;Mike Green in Shorts.&quot;  Hence I slapped my desk, scared an intern and nearly spilled my lunch.  Warn a girl, eh?

I&#039;m with you on this topic.  Fidget&#039;s shirt is too long in this video, but Ovi&#039;s got some junk in the trunk.  Still, I can&#039;t help it... all roads lead back to Sid.  There is no denying the wagon that Crosby is draggin&#039;.

As I said waaaaaay back in the second or third ever post on this site, Sid could get arrested for wearing shorts.  Or maybe he wears shorts and I get arrested.  Semantics.

PS: Mr. Cherrie for Husband of the Year, just for listening to you talk about this.  Mr. Pants and I aren&#039;t even married and he&#039;s learned to tune out 90% of what I say during a hockey game.]]></description>
