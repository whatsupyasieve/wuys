		<description><![CDATA[Ez,

We feel you on this.  As Boston University alumni, we know there is really no way to make your cuddly mascot look cute.  A Boston Terrier?  I had one that just snorted and farted all day (looking adorable, of course).  Not exactly the way to strike fear into the heart of your opponent.  The only time that dog ever bit me was when I tried to separate it from a bag of Skittles.

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s hard to make a penguin look tough. But that penguin looks like the silhouette of a classic yinzer at a Steeler tailgate party. (beer gut from too much Iron City, scarf and no shirt. It also resembles &quot;Chilly Willy&quot; from the Hanna Barbera cartoon era. yuck. But, I guess it&#039;s better than the 90&#039;s penguin logo, though (Triangle penguin head)

Love your blog!
