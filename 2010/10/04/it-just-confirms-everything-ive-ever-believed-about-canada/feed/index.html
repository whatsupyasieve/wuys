		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not a deep seeded hatered for Canada. It&#039;s called fairness to all players regardless of their birth place an opportunity to represent their country proudly in the Olympics. I mentioned that even Sidney Crosby supported Ovi&#039;s desire to play in Russia. It&#039;s simply my opinion. I don&#039;t hate Canada. I simply don&#039;t feel it&#039;s fair to pull that opportunity after Canadian&#039;s have it. If the shoe were on the other foot, I think they would feel the same way and I would write about tha as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How the 2010 Winter Olympics went for me...

Everyone I know on Twitter and Facebook: &quot;Oh my God, hockey is so awesome.&quot;

Me: &quot;DUHIHAVEBEENTELLINGYOUTHATFOR20YEARS!&quot;

Everyone: &quot;It&#039;s over.  Back to the Law &#038; Order marathon.&quot;

But for that one brief, shining moment, Americans cared.  That makes NHL in the Olympics totally worth it.  What better way to gain fans than by knocking their socks off then saying, &quot;Hey, we do this every night!&quot;  All Evan Lysacek does these days is get drunk on TMZ.

Get on the horn with NBC and sort out their issues - like not airing the Canada/US first-round game last winter.  As if they knew it would be the best gold medal game since Miracle.  Nonsense (Miss Cleo is in jail and not currently taking calls for psychic advice).  Fix it, so we can have Miracle 2014.]]></description>
