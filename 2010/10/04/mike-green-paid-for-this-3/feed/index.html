		<description><![CDATA[I forgot to tell you about my crazy dream last night!  Like craaaazy!

I had a dream that I was marrying Mike Green.  We were bowling and he asked me marry him.  I said YES.  My mom came into the room to tell me that dinner was ready.  I told her that Mike and I were getting married.  She was totes not enthusiastic.  Then a jeweler guy appeared with those black velvet trays full of diamonds ring and Mike told me to pick anyone I wanted.

I don&#039;t know why I had this dream.  I don&#039;t even really like MG.  But maybe my subconscious is trying to tell me something, all Leo-DiCaprio-in-Inception like. Maybe I SUPPOSED to like Mike Green??]]></description>
