		<description><![CDATA[After last night, my eyes were bleeding and it belongs in a horror movie! SERIOUSLY ... it was scary! But not as scary as Kelly Chase&#039;s spasmodically viagra-induced rendition of Gary Moore&#039;s &quot;Still Got the Blues for You&quot; with fist pumping and strange gesticulations ... yeah. I had serious nightmares and he should have went home. :0]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My first ever slow dance with a boy was to &quot;Every Rose Has it&#039;s Thorn&quot; - it was a few years after that song was cool, but we&#039;re from the country so we didn&#039;t know.  It was also the only song my college roommate knew on the guitar... good times.]]></description>
