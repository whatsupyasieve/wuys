		<description><![CDATA[Mike... suit... we could have lobster bisque at Faneuil Hall then walk to the game and have a suite party!  Is it cold enough to wear mittens?  Because that&#039;s pretty much the only thing missing from this dream.  Life would be so much better if we were in charge.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have to admit that I am sort of PO&#039;d with Mikey for not coming to see me.  What, is he too good to travel with the team, wear a suit, nosh on some popcoren and look hot in the team suite?  BizNasty does it.  And so has Marc Savard and some of the BU players, so why not you, Michael?

BTDubs - is it weird that I really think it is really sexy when players lose teeth, shed blood, require stitches, for their team?  Remember Joe Thornton and his black eyeball?  That was hot!]]></description>
