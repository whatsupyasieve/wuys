		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s sad Chuck, but nobody does it better than those crazy canadians -nobody. You won&#039;t believe the grief Mr. Cherrie and I get when we make a run for the border -to Tim Horton&#039;s. You&#039;d think we were smuggling drugs. All we want are coffee and crullers - STAT! Because we can. We live close enough dammit!]]></description>
