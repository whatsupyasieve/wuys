		<description><![CDATA[This is my favorite deranged hockey daydream EVER.  Sid would be clumsy and I could be mean, with 80s hair, pretending he doesn&#039;t know how to read.  And we could fight when he tries to give me a Lemiuex jersey for Christmas.  And Locke from LOST could pressure me to marry Ilya Kovalchuk, because he still plays in the NHL, but I&#039;d gloriously refuse as Sid and I take the ice for the final episode and win with a stunning, death-defying move called The Malkin.  Ovi can be our coach.  Chuck can be the girl whose name Sid can&#039;t remember at the beginning: &quot;Rita?  Anita?&quot;]]></description>
