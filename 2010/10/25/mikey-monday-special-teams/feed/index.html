		<description><![CDATA[I would also like it noted that I called the hat trick for Semin BEFORE it happened ... And Mikey was petitioning to play in OT but because Pants was MIA on text and I knew she was stepping out in Mikey, I didn&#039;t want to hurt his feelings so I just kept talking to the TV and encouraging his play which OBVIOUSLY worked. As I told Pants, The Caps need his Defensive Magic and YES, a whole team CAN and Does depend on one man, our Mikey does it all - and does it quite cutely.]]></description>
