		<description><![CDATA[How sweet!  Ovi needs someone with a roll of duct tape to shut him up sometimes, but as long as he keeps scoring goals I suppose we&#039;ll give him a visa.  As long as he has all his shots.

PS: I pointed out to Mr. Pants the other day that there&#039;s no way Sidney Crosby knows how to make eggs on naan with lentils, heirloom tomatoes, mixed greens and balsamic reduction for breakfast.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ovi has made this comment before so it&#039;s no surprise. It lit up the message boards. He needs a publicist - STAT. I&#039;m the girl for the job! I could put my publicist pants on and keep them on ... HAHAHAH! And technically, Americans are the fattest people in the world not that we want to be called out by a Russian in our own national publication. HOWEVER - if you see the chicks he&#039;s been photographed with, they don&#039;t exactly look happy to be with him, so really? Except for the chain smoking, trashy brunette he was chkicken dancing with and she wasn&#039;t exactly a catch. So I&#039;m not exactly jealous of Pebbles if that&#039;s what it takes to catch he eye - I&#039;ll take Mr. Cherrie ANY DAY!]]></description>
