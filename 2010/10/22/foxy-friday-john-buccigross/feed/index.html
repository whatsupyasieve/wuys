ALL THE SINGLE LADIES!!&quot;.

		<description><![CDATA[Any one that can get Alex to actually answer a question with a sentence has to be a good interview and wicked smart! Thanks Chuck! That made my Friday but I agree with the jersey .. who listens to the Tragically Hip anymore or EVER? I hung out with them back in the day and they were just plain tragic. :(]]></description>
