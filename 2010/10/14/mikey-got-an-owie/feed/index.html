		<description><![CDATA[Had you seen that interview? He&#039;s actually pretty adorable in it. But not exactly high aspirations if not a hockey player but I guess he really never thought of being anything else which is cool. And what is up with the tongue? Seriously? Dry mouth? Dehydrated? I half expected him to fall over like the goalie from the other night ... which again, sorry he got a concussion, but that was HILARIOUS to just see him drop. I guess he knew he was going down and tried to get the attention from the bench.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We should just change the name of this blog to &quot;What&#039;s Up, Mike Green?&quot;  I&#039;m posting this comment from the couch while Mike gets me more miso soup (my favorite).

What if Mike was an elevator mechanic?  I&#039;d pulling wires and getting stuck in that thing every damned day.  An electrician?  I can blow fuses, baby.

PS: That&#039;s totally me doing the interview.

PPS: Gotta go, the movie&#039;s back on.]]></description>
