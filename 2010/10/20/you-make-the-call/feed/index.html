		<description><![CDATA[I absolutely clap when my team wins a fight but if I were that close to ANY NHL player who just had a fight, there is NO WAY IN HELL I would be provoking them especially when there is no barrier between me and them - even if it was Sidney Crosby - with how much I can&#039;t stand him. It&#039;s called RESPECT.It&#039;s also called COMMON SENSE. Two things most NHL fans don&#039;t have. And while I don&#039;t think any professional player should put their hands on a fan, if said fan is taunting them and there is no barrier between them, then like I said, you may get more than you bargained for. That&#039;s why I said, You make the call. Beating your wife is a whole other issue though. Love the discussion! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, how is that fan stupid?  Don&#039;t you clap when your team wins a fight?  He didn&#039;t do anything else.  The only mistake this fan made was paying that much for seats.

I think this is ridiculous and disgusting, as if it&#039;s okay for a player who fights on the ice to go home and beat his wife.  Sorry to get on my soap box, but if you can&#039;t police yourself off the ice you will never be able to do it on the ice.  And that&#039;s where my boys are.  So Rick Rypien, who I&#039;ve never even heard of, you&#039;re a piece of crap.

The &#039;79 Milbury fight is funny now, because it looks like a commercial for Slap Shot.  But I bet it wasn&#039;t funny at the time.  Hockey players or not, human beings should be smarter than this.]]></description>
