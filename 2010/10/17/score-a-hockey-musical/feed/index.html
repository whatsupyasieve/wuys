If Pants and I ran our own movie studio, these are the sort of movies that we would make.  Along with anything starring Nathan Fillion, Ben Affleck/Matt Damon, or Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones.  Or any combination of the four.]]></description>

But we will offer hospitality to anyone who wants to stay with us on the road trip to canada to go see this fine use of celluloid because we are SO THERE! And being the closest to the border ... I think we have the best bet to this in an actual theatre!]]></description>
