		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know ... I kept waiting for a response. And nothing. I was going to add in a fully functional babe lair but it&#039;s Sidney. I&#039;m not sure he&#039;d know what to do with it. I think it&#039;s going to look more like Pee wee&#039;s play house with Chairy! And I&#039;m sure he&#039;d take the dryer with him when he goes. He&#039;d score more with that than any thing else. Oh snap. OK - I&#039;m done ragging on him - I promise. No more. It&#039;s too easy any way. ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[HOW DID I MISS THIS!?!?!  Quit ragging on Sid.  You know the Lemieux palace takes up like 3 blocks and Sid probably doesn&#039;t even see them every day.  Except that he wants to, because wouldn&#039;t you?!]]></description>
