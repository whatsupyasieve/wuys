		<description><![CDATA[Black americans should like hockey why : 1) it&#039;s the fastest and best game in the world , look i love Football as well but hockey is fantastic. 2) If you like football you should like hockey because it has SPEED, CONTACT, (COLLISIONS WOULD BE A BETTER DESCRIPTION ) it takes lots of skill to play. kids have to start at an early age because it takes years of practice to learn to do the things NHL players do. No other sport gives you the action hockey does,Plus it&#039;s hard to play people have to learn to ice skate and a lot of people can&#039;t skate well. Many a good hockey player has never made it to the NHL because of his skating was not up to par !!!!!    HOCKEY RULES]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I heart Jerome. Calargy is actually my team because Mikka and Jerome. I just wish they&#039;d get Jerome some support. I think the Olympics show just how good he really is. And Dustin is up and coming. Too bad they dismantled their cup team. But The Donald is my man as per my recent post. He had Ovie&#039;s back for a while and he the last of a dying a dying breed. :)]]></description>
