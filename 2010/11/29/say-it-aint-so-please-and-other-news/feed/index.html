		<description><![CDATA[How is it pure bs?? That is the best you got. Hence why I call some people cwnlos on this blog. Drury is overpaid for his skills that&#039;s a fact. Yes blame Sather but his last 2 years in Buffalo were better than any of the years we had him. WE DIDN&#039;T SIGN HIM TO REVERT BACK. He should have improved or continued from Buffalo. It&#039;s his own fault for signing such a lucrative deal. He can&#039;t deliver and especially after last years embarrassment I don;t think he will ever get his confidence back. You see it all the time in sports when players sign for to much and can&#039;t handle the pressure. LI Joe you sir know nothing. Defend the scrapes by blaming other nonsense things you clown!!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fopr the record ladies, I HATE Avery. He&#039;s right up there at the top of my list that includes Hossa, Ovi and, well, the entire Philadelphia Flyers current Roster. Particular venom reserved for Carbomb and Hartnell *hisssssssss*.

But Avery? 1) Gets an internship at a fashion magazine. 2) whines like a girl. Actually, that&#039;s unkind to girls. Whines like a Pommy B***ard, as the Aussies would say. 3) Does not seem to grasp the simple concept that there is no &quot;i&quot; in TEAM. The man seems to be only out for hisself.  And lastly - I have long suspected he keeps stealing Henrik Lundqvist&#039;s GHD straighteners and hogs all the mirror time in the lockerroom.

Enough said.  ONe of my friends said she thinks he&#039;s a bad boy. Words failed me.  They actually did.

Oh dear. Did I go too far? And as for Hossa - SHOULD NEVER HAVE GOT TO RAISE LORD STAN&#039;S CUP SECOND.

That is all.]]></description>
