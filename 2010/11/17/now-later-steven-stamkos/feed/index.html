		<description><![CDATA[YES! That tardy ... hahahah and no, not Seth himself. Seth is like 4 feet tall in real life. I know. I accidentally told him he was cute and small. LOL!
BTW - Mr. Cherrie can wear my jeans but they are too long for him since he is shorter than me. Is that bad? HA! ;)]]></description>
