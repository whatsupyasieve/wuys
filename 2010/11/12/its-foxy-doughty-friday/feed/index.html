		<description><![CDATA[Negative - Mike&#039;s hair is a 10+ and Doughty&#039;s is like a 7.  He aspires to be like Mike, probably wears cardigans and moccasins too in his quest.  But there is only one Fidget.

Drew is uber-cute though and if you drive around LA, you can see him as part of the worst advertising campaign in history.  The Kings have billboards all over that just have a HUGE face (in helmet and everything) and a huge last name.  That&#039;s it.  Billboard-sized close-up is approved from Doughty but the Kopitar one almost made me drive off the road on purpose.]]></description>
