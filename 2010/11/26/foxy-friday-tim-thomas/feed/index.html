		<description><![CDATA[I applaud this for two reasons ...1. I wouldn&#039;t say his form is flopping - it&#039;s &#039;unconventional&#039; and &#039;unpredictable&#039; which is good. It even throws Ovi off. 2. Timmy is awesome. Good job Chuck! Even if a little obvious given you are a Bruins fan. ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[CHUCK! We have missed you around here.  Excellent FF selection.  And you know me - Rob Weasley has been my underage boyfriend for like 12 years.  I get older, but the best-looking guys all stay the same age.

I should point out that blue-collar-hot utility company guys who you see getting coffee every morning only exist on the east coast.  I never, ever see them in CA.  Lucky girl.

Also, I checked and I&#039;m closer in age to both Tazer and Crosby than I am to Matt Damon.  They may be younger than I am, but at least I&#039;m still shopping in the right aisle.]]></description>
