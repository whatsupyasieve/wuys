		<description><![CDATA[OK so top moment for me - THW &#039;TACHE IS GAWN! Hallelujah indeed!
Second moment: Little Sid and his goal scoring celebration - awww cute
Jordan&#039;s cup adjusting - yeah, he totally had to do that LOL.
And... I almost feel sorry for Ovi. Almost. But, that&#039;s like the whole holiday season he&#039;s spent with Nicky.  Aww. Think Brooks is feeling jealous? Cause I&#039;ll comfort him :D]]></description>
