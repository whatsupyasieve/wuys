		<description><![CDATA[Aaah - now I get it.  Thx.  That Pitbull song?

*Evil grin*. Won&#039;t say what I&#039;m thinking right now. Better not leave me unattended in a room with ANY on my list.  That&#039;s all I&#039;m saying.

PS You ignored then hands-y comment Pants??? LOL]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Go to Youtube and search for the &quot;Let&#039;s Get it On&quot; video.  or &quot;Futuresex/Lovesounds&quot; by Justin Timberlake.  Or anything by Color Me Badd (right, Chuck?).  These embody the idea of Brown Chicken, Brown Cow.  It basically means, in the immortal words of Pitbull, &quot;I know you want me, You know I want you.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes but what does it mean???

Btw - don&#039;t think I would be able to stop myself from getting hands-y with Fidget.

Just sayin&#039;.

PS - I think Brooks has an HBO fan club or the editor is a woman/gay, cause how much airtime is he getting!? Like, it&#039;s the Brooks show with a bit of hockey :D

Do love. Also the snowglobe :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You know in old movies when there&#039;s a hot girl and they play the sound effect &quot;bowchickabowwow&quot;?  Well that&#039;s Brown Chicken, Brown Cow.  Or at least how we&#039;ve always tried to class it up.  Because that&#039;s us: classy.

Poor Fidget, he just likes to hug!  I&#039;d hug him!  And I&#039;d totally hit up a Swedish Christmas dinner, that looked delicious.  Even if everyone wore hats at the table (rude!).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Less screaming, more glazed eyed looking at the screen.  Let&#039;s face it, there was a LOT of Brooks to love in that episode.  He&#039;s just so..so...so....Brooksy. :D

Loving the Nicky-Fidget Bromance; right down to Mike meeting the family and spending Christmas Swedish style.  Awww. Coincidence that it&#039;s Nicky that hugs Mike from behind during that goal? I think not.

Can I also say the soundtrack was awesome too?  And the looks Disco was giving Sid ROFL when the kid was dishing out shoot-out advice. I&#039;d like Disco to be MY Dad.  Actually I kind of wish Coach Julien was my Dad and Asst Coach Ward was my uncle, but...

PS Pls explain the Brown cow expression thingy.  Pls.  LOL]]></description>
