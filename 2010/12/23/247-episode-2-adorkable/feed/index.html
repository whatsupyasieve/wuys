		<description><![CDATA[Finally saw it. Think I&#039;m even more in love with Laich than I was before. Is that possible?

That kid was just too cute. But it was &quot;uncle&quot; Max that really did it for me - I volunteer to be his babymomma!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A-a-a-and guess who&#039;s having to wait until HBO decide they&#039;re going to upload the video onto their website?  And what do you do Pants? YOU ONLY GO AND PUT A SCREENCAP OF BROOKS UP THERE.  Payback?  You are taunting me.  Taunting.

I&#039;m going to have to do parts deux on BOTH of those things now.  You just wait. :D

PS Bruins Calendar arrived today. :D *happy dance* But no TIMMMMMMAY :(]]></description>
