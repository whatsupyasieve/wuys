		<description><![CDATA[I meant that Pants failed to mention that the Pens were being SPANKED not the stache. She only talked about the stache. Sorry I wasn&#039;t clear enough. :) No one could miss that stache. But good idea about Ovi giving him a Gillete. I see a bromance in their future!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dawn - whaddya mean you weren&#039;t aware of the caterpillar-with-mange lip situation going on with Sid?

Me and the girls are plotting.  I&#039;d even sweet-talk Ovi to get one of the Gillete&#039;s he&#039;s got going on.

And you know how I feel about HIM.]]></description>
