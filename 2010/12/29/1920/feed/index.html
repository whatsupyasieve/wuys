		<description><![CDATA[Um, he &#039;lives&#039; with his &#039;friend&#039; paul who looks like a poor man&#039;s adrien brody. when she asks &#039;what&#039;s that relationship like?&#039; REALLY? um.... Do we want to go there? Because it seems like Mike doesn&#039;t want to be alone and if he ever get&#039;s a girlfriend - said girlfriend will never be alone. Unless it&#039;s Nicky B. and then we all know that will be a group grope! ;) Or Ovi will just shove Paul out the door, give him a $100 and tell Paul to get lost of a couple of hours.]]></description>
