		<description><![CDATA[Oh, did I fail to mention that? ;) yeah I was too depressed to go in-depth on the monemental meltdown they are in .... sigh. Going back to bed now. Dreaming of last year when they were actually good. What good was that trade with Fleischman for that useless piece of crap from Colorado? Seriously? He trip Varly and allowed a goal. I could go on and on ... They are like watching the Keystone Cops now and I don&#039;t even like that kind of humor.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1) You lucky girls getting that intense stare.  Wow.  I&#039;m not saying I&#039;d ever go for Tazer, but...wow...Intense.

2) Ryane Clowe - yeah saw that on Twitter this am and was positive that your Foxy Friday shout out inspired the dude!

3) That&#039;s it.  The &#039;tache has got to go.  It&#039;s just...wrong.  But given he&#039;s wearing it with that hat...oh good lord, he doesn&#039;t think the &#039;tache has magical goal-giving properties does he? &#039;Cause we all know how superstitious the Next One is.
