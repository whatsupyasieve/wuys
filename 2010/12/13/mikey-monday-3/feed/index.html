		<description><![CDATA[Pants - STOP telling everyone about my Laich love!  I want to be able to hold my head up in Boston next time I drink/get drunk with the coaching team!

OK, thoughts;

1) Who let Ovi near a gun? Just sayin&#039;
2) Yeah the hugging it out thing.  Somethin&#039; going on there for sure.
3) I think all of us Fidget fans should take note of his new finger-printing skills. Just sayin&#039;
4) Whoever that was at the start of the SWAT thing - nice ass!

And yes, I&#039;ll volunteer to nurse Fidget through his flu - I am available :D

Still giggling over the Belfast Giants video rofl.]]></description>
