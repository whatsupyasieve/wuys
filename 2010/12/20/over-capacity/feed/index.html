		<description><![CDATA[THAT ad is one of the best ever.  Even better than the Playoffs ones which make me wibble.

I like Luongo and the feather duster. Closely followed by Sid&#039;s non-wooden &quot;Ovechkin&quot; bit at the end :D.

You so know that was like all the pranks they ever played on rookies rolled into one. LOL.

I wonder who won that pillow fight?  I know a girl who woulda loved to have been in the middle there...

PS It&#039;s up baby! Pants you know what I mean!!!]]></description>
