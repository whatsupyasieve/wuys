		<description><![CDATA[Good, so you&#039;re meeting me at Dulles with your own bag of tricks, right?

Cause there&#039;s no way I can handle two of them.

Let&#039;s face it - one look at Brooks and I&#039;m just a massive puddle of mush inside...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Which one? The ones work gave me or the naughty one? Are you encouraging me to sabotage the Caps before the WC?

Requested!? Really?! Who by? I understand Fidget has been a bit under the weather too. Let&#039;s face it; both of their ages combined is older than me :D

Or does a certain blond Canadian know I&#039;m writing a oneshot right now?

This is ALL your fault Pants...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I kinda like his hair!  Then I watched the Taylor-v-Miley video.  BROOKS LIKES MILEY! Does that mean I have to now?

Not enough Brooks in that 24/7 reaction video. Nope.  And did you see @MDZ tweeted someone a happy birthday?? Awwww.  Doesn&#039;t it make you just want to, well, cuddle him or pat him on top of the head or something.

Short comment: I&#039;m currently trying to find out if ANYONE is flying out to DC from the snow-bound UK, cause I think Brooks needs some decent home care and also his laundry done. I think Fidget will not look after him properly.

Just sayin&#039;.]]></description>
