		<description><![CDATA[Seriously .. Sid&#039;s eyes totally lit up when he mentions Flower ... it was actually cute. Did I just say that? He is totes in love with Flower. I bet they sleep in each other&#039;s laps on long flights and snuggle under the blanket. It&#039;s probably like, &quot;No you can have the arm rest.&quot; &quot;On no, you had like, 35 saves tonight - you have it.&quot; &quot;No, i couldn&#039;t.&quot; &quot;I really insist&quot; &quot;But...&quot; &quot;No.&quot; I could go on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bahahahahahahahahaha.  Mile high club.  Sid is totally a robot, but I love him.  I will take him home and plug him in every night, like Small Wonder (no jokes about being in the closet).  Poor guy doesn&#039;t get much to talk about that&#039;s not hockey - let him talk about his friends!

PS: Flower is the best thing ever.  So smiley!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sid&#039;s package is better than Ovi&#039;s - you should see Shanny&#039;s birthday cake vid on YouTube. Several members of a judging panel (my non hockey loving friends) agreed and said they&#039;d do Sid over Ovi any day (even if they didn&#039;t like his looks either) as a result!

		<description><![CDATA[OMG - underwear!  I managed to miss that part last night.  Now I am scarred for life.  Maybe Mike wears sunglasses all the time because his retinas are damaged from seeing Ovi parading around the locker room in his skivvies.  ::shudder::]]></description>
