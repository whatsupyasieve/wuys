		<description><![CDATA[Cassy, the scene with the rookies was one of my favorites too!  They were so adamant about finding out you did that to them!  Yet, we too scared to do anything about it.

&quot;Please don&#039;t be 622.  Please don&#039;t be 622.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I SAW IT I SAW IT I SAW IT!!!!!Either there is a God or I apparently am Fauxnadian and enough of a hockey nut to merit special permissions from my IP address to watch it from the website!!

Am sick, so the sight of Brooks&#039; blue eyes, chiselled jaw, well kempt beard, cropped hair, those looks and that accent have almost finished me off in my weakened state.

Loved every second.  Esp the rookies&#039; comment about doing nothing about it ;)

*Cassy tries to do happy dance and falls over due to being so ill*

Fidget needs a cuddle.  Can I volunteer?  And I would so have flown over to personally nurse Brooks had I known he was sick.

And finally the &#039;tache mystery answered.  Anyone else want to join me in a rendition of &quot;Superstition&quot;? Anyone? And yeah, giggly girls #87 and #29. Gotcha.  Concur.

		<description><![CDATA[No joy on HBO - I am thwarted at every turn. Good thing is, looks like emigrating might be my only option as there are no jobs here. Silver link g anyone?

DID YOU GUYS TAPE IT FOR ME? Should I just call Brooks, Fidget or Max and just cry about it and hope they take pity on me and sort out their TIVO or whatever? Hmmm. I do know some coaches in Boston... Hmmm]]></description>
