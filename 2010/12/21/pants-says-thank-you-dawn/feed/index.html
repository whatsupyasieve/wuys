		<description><![CDATA[Oh boy.  He is most definitely a dork.  But we loves those sort of guys anyway.  They&#039;re way more fun!

I watched some of the Caps game last night (they were victorious!) and at one point, there was a bit of a scrum and Mikey was there, hovering on the periphery attempting to look bad-ass.  But all I could envision was him slap fighting someone and running away...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[SHUT THE FRONT DOOR!  This made my day. Especially since I&#039;ve been at work since 6-something AM.

Things I learned from this:
1. Mike is a tool.
2. &lt;strong&gt;I am definitely in love with him.&lt;/strong&gt;
3. More fights, please.  Because slapping people is hilarious.
4. OBVIOUSLY I have to buy a skateboard deck with Mike&#039;s face painted on it.
5. Going to buy Maxim right now.

If you want to read it (you know you do!) it&#039;s at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maxim.com/amg/STUFF/Articles/Mike+Green:+Skate+or+Die&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>
