		<description><![CDATA[You can&#039;t leave me hanging like that Pants!  Are you on a permanent Canadian blacklist or what?!

(And I can&#039;t really speak - I finish so many of my sentences with &quot;eh&quot; it&#039;s not funny, eh?).

If you start saying &quot;aboot&quot; we&#039;ll start a campaign for you to officially get dual citizenship :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a full-fledged Fauxnadian.  Typical scene:

2006, driving cross-country from LA to NY with my dad.  We get to Niagra Falls.  You can drive across.  My VW Jetta is packed with everything I own and has a bumper sticker: I Love Canadian Boys.

My dad said, &quot;They&#039;re going to take one look at you, this car and that sticker and they will never let you across the border.&quot;]]></description>
