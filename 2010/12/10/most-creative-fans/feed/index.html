		<description><![CDATA[Lordy, that&#039;s a good waste of waffles! Maybe they ran out of maple syrup at the concession stands?

And haven&#039;t they done not so bad lately? Didn&#039;t they beat the Caps recently? Who I believe were also beaten by.... THE FLORIDA PANTHERS?!?!

They sound like the equivalent of the Welsh Rugby team during the 6 Nations - lose to everybody, except the English (so they don&#039;t win).  In this case, lose to most except the underdogs and the Caps (so they&#039;re not top of the conference).

(sorry Dawn - love to hate &#039;em)]]></description>
