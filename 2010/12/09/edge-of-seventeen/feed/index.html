		<description><![CDATA[I did ask Mel to make sure he got a Gillette Mach 3 at the CBJ game, but apparently that didn&#039;t work. Should we start a sign campaign? Personally, I think it&#039;s gonna take us all going to the &#039;Burgh to seduce his teammates into helping us with our mission: you guys find that hat, we&#039;ll burn it and let&#039;s get him drunk and we&#039;ll hold him down while you shave that horrible man fur off his upper lip.  You in?

Movember is over Sid! I couldn&#039;t rock the tache either, but props for still supporting the cause...]]></description>
