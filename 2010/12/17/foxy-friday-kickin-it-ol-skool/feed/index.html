		<description><![CDATA[Oh by the way, Mikey was my first NHL game too ... not including some Vancouver game Mr. Cherrie made me go to that we can&#039;t even remember who played. SORRY MR. C. XXOO

Mr. Cuzzo and I took in the game and I screamed in his ear and shook his arm off. I sent hubby photos of it though and called him all through the game. It was AWESOME!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[um ... I am sad to say that I am OLDER than Mike Modano people - NOT MUCH -  so let&#039;s be SENSITIVE to the cougar town remarks. And yes, that could make me Ovi&#039;s mom if you do the math - so math, not my friend. Years ... not my friend. HA!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You were totally cool! I think that we did a good job even though inside we were doing flips.

Mike is really that old?  Whoa.  I stand corrected.
Pants no longer lives in Cougar Town...

		<description><![CDATA[PS: GUESS WHAT?!  For all the fun Chuck makes of me for liking players who are not &quot;age appropriate,&quot; I did a little internet data entry and came up with this gem.  I am closer in age to both Crosby and Toews than I am to Mike Modano.

Mike: 9 years, 4 months and change
Sid: 7 years, 9 months and change
Jon: 8 years, 6 months and change

HA.  Exit from Cougar Town.  For once, math is my friend.

Excellent choice, Dawn.  Bravo.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent FF Selection!  Mike was one of my first hockey loves (him and Eric Lindros).  I must have watch his scene in &quot;The Mighty Ducks&quot; like 1,000 times.

While his choice in a wife is dubious, he is an extremely foxy man.  Pants and I can attest when we serendipitously saw him at the Viceroy in Santa Monica one night.

SCENE: Pants and Chuck at the bar, drinking alcohol.
Chuck:  Hey Pants wouldn&#039;t be be really cool if we saw a hockey player.
Pants: Totes!
Enter Mike Modano from the door behind Pants.
Chuck: uhhhhhhhhh
Pants:  What? What is it?
Chuck: mmmmmmmmrrrrrgggguhhhh I think our wish just came true.
Pants: Shut the front door!
Chuck: Turn around.  Slowly.  And all cool like.]]></description>
