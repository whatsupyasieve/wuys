		<description><![CDATA[Could have been worse; could have been Avery&#039;s she landed up with.

Lundqvist is known as &quot;The King&quot; in my house (I once wrote a song about him and posted it on NHL.com on my page AHEM)

And we call Callahan &quot;Wee Ryan&quot; :)]]></description>

PS: Tell MDZ to give Stephanie&#039;s Twitter handle to Callahan.  She tried to buy a jersey and they were out of A&#039;s so she had to get Lundqvuist.]]></description>
