		<description><![CDATA[Dawn, I &#060;3 you, I really do, but

NO NO NO.

For me that would be like crushing on Avery *shudders*, Hossa (HISS - actually I feel nauseous) or, EVEN WORSE Hartnell and Carbomb (someone dial 911 - I think I need a doctor!)

Can I just stick to Bergy, TIMMMMAY, Maxime, LePretty, Sid, baby Jordy, Sharpie (it&#039;s a hair thing), Ryder, Hunwick (OK most of the Bruins roster) and now...Fidget and Laichs (all you guys&#039; fault)??? I&#039;m not picky.

I asked for Bergy or Sid for Christmas.  I am not being greedy; one will do.  But I think Pants has dibs on that hunk of hawtness from Cole Harbor.

But I will admit there are SHORT MILLISECOND MOMENTS in the Winter Classic ad where Ovi looked ALMOST cute.

(Look, I am admitting to a teensy crush on Fidget and his bromance BF Brooks and I NEVER thought that possible.  Isn&#039;t that enough? &#039;K? ;))

Wubs ladies xxx]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That was poor.  And you know me; so damn hockey deprived I&#039;ll take ANYTHING! Even Ovie.  Yes you can say that about his hair.  He almost looks like a little good-looking in this, with the water and all, but then I suddenly totally developed a crush on MAF.

Time to get to the opticians?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cass - There&#039;s a link there in the first paragraph.  It may not inspire my mom to watch a hockey game, but it&#039;s worth watching for Sidney&#039;s usual, ridiculously attractive self.  The boy does not disappoint.

Plus, I kinda like Ovi&#039;s hair.  Can I say that?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sidney = *phowar*
But this commerical is lame.  You can&#039;t even show them actually PLAYING hockey.  If you don&#039;t know who they are, then you have absolutely no clue what this commercial is about.
It sort of looks like an ad for Storm Force coverage on the Weather Channel.

I feel like I need to get Dawn&#039;s cell phone # so I can send her mad texts during the game...like every time the refer to Ovi and his Russian-ness.  BOOM!]]></description>
