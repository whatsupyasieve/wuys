		<description><![CDATA[I cannot tell a lie...

My friend Kimmy found the video on Puck Daddy and she posted it on the hocky FF newsgroup which is how I brought it to your attention.  Then Mere pointed out that most of those boys are American or Canadian (the world&#039;s tallest elf is American from NJ apparently) and although I tried really hard, Mel did most of the posting tweets to the profiles of all the hockey players on Twitter we&#039;re stalking, sorry following.  We knew Loops was on the team bus last night, so we were hoping he caught the tweet to him and shared it with the rest of the Ducks, then hopped over to the Caps dressing room and told them.  Along with Puck Daddy, we&#039;re trying to make sure as many NHLers find this as possible!

Cause then we might just get Malkin as the elf.  Personally I&#039;m all for my beloved Bruins doing ditto. Although I&#039;d prefer to see #37 doing the lip-syncing, it would be much funnier if it was Chara...

I aim to please...]]></description>
