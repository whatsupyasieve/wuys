		<description><![CDATA[Um ... you forget to use ALL CAPS when referring to MAX TALBOT and also failed to mention to drink every time Ovi is shirtless. That will get you drunk the fastest - I PROMISE. ;) Mr. Cherrie ... please call Comcast and upgrade stat if it&#039;s only ten bucks. I can whore myself out some more in December for screenings.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excited for the game, I think Max is more EXCITING in the video (and isn&#039;t Dawn a Caps fan??).

So, Pants, what you&#039;re saying is I should just get drunk now, right? And yes, I will be watching the Winter Classic on ESPN Player :D. I introduced my nephew to hockey last year.  He sat on my knee watching the game, aged 3.  He is fully cogniscent of who Sidney Crosby and Patrice Bergeron are.

By the way, can someone record/buy/mug an HBO staff member for all the TV spots and DVD of this series?  I&#039;m UK bound and DEPRIVED!

PS Dawnie - fight you for a job as an HBO/Sports reporter with special Talbot interviewing assignments. :D]]></description>
