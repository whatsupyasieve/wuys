Funny considering he didn&#039;t even finish the European equivalent of high school.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Re: Kopitar
I know! I was like &quot;Whaaaaaaaa?&quot; He sort of looks like Geico caveman so the voice totally doesn&#039;t match.

I&#039;m totally voting for Jeff Skinner for Prom King.]]></description>

2. as a hawks fan i have always been hesitant about the penguins but with the HBO and ASG coverage i may have fallen in love with fleury. and he is a goalie which is even weirder for me.
3. i almost fell off my couch when i heard kopitar talk. not at all what i expected.]]></description>
