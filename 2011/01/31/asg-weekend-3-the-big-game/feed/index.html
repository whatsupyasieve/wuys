		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for showing the videos. I am not a big fan of the all-star games these days. The skills competition also seemed a lot more exciting to be honest. I really didn’t enjoy that relay where they passed into those little nets and stuff. I wish they would bring back the speed skating through the cones (when Kariya used to always win). The game itself was pathetic as usual, no checking, and obviously no hitting. 21 goals combined is just ridiculous, I don’t understand why they can’t check a little. I wish they could change the NHL game to make it more exciting but I don’t see that happening. Also, you think you could take a look at my blog cuz I really wanna hear what you have to say. http://chrisross91.wordpress.com/2011/01/31/get-rid-of-em/]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I also was unhappy with Carey Price&#039;s performance. Ugh.

Also, is it okay that I want Cam Ward? My friends criticized me all weekend because they claim he looks like a 15 year old boy. Yikes.]]></description>
