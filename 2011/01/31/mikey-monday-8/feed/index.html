		<description><![CDATA[I dunno Chuck, I&#039;d hang around the Garden more. Lots of Canadians on the B&#039;s... have you SEEN Bergy with his ever-present scruff? PHWOOOOAAAAAR! Imagine that in a lumberjack shirt!

Or even Michael Ryder. That also has possibilities in a Lumberjack shirt and with some scruff.  Yummy.

Not as yummy as Bergy. Or Laich. Or Savvy. Or Fidget. Or LePretty. Or Sid. Or Flower. (Actually scratch Sid. He has no man-beard growing powers. But Maxime... Talbot, baby, TALBOT!)

I am an equal-opportunity pervert. I am sure I have mentioned this before.]]></description>
