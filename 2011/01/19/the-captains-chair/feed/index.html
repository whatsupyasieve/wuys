		<description><![CDATA[I am all giddy - Firefly AND hockey?!? Yay! I think I&#039;ve got psychic powers - I totes picked EStaal for Cap! I&#039;d like LePretty and Green on his team, plus I hope he gets TIMMMMAAYY and Chara too!! Chuck - you&#039;re so my new BFF!

I bet Listrom picks MStaal. Just to mess with EStaal&#039;s head! But a Team Staal could be fun...

Boo on the food poisoning Pants - it&#039;s truly awful business. I hope Fidget has been tasked to nurse you and kiss your boo-boos better. Happy stalking too - :D kiss Mr Blue Blue Eyes for me when you see him! And keep your eyes on the mail.

Dawn - wear it as a vest. Them tell Mr Cherrie if he doesn&#039;t let you wear it you&#039;ve got a friend who&#039;ll whip up loads of t-shirts with his face on, including cat sizes, and everyone will be wearing them... ;)]]></description>
