		<description><![CDATA[You say it doesn&#039;t make sense to have Clay Aiken singing the national anthem. There are several things I feel are important when choosing someone to sing the national anthem.  First of all, they need to have a great voice.  Second, they need to be professional and be prepared.  Third, they should sing the song without adding a lot of vocal gymnastics and give the song the respect it deserves.  Looks to me like Clay has all the qualifications for the job and choosing him makes perfect sense to me.  After listening to the video posted above, I&#039;m sure most of you will agree with me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Maybe Aikenâ€™s performance will turn a whole new middle-aged generation of Claymates into avid hockey fans.&quot;

Clay Aiken fan here--grew up in NH--went to UNH--great hockey team--my three daughters were all big hockey fans (Bruins and UNH) also.

Being a Clay Aiken fan and a hockey fan are not mutually exclusive!!

Sterotypes abound!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Okay, I&#039;m pulling editorial rank and deleting the comment by &quot;Real Hockey Fan.&quot;  Disagreeing is fine, provided you can make your argument without slurs, speculation, name-calling or foul language.

Everyone up to this point has stated their opinion in a very respectful way - exactly what I would have expected from Clay Aiken fans.  This discussion has really impressed me and I hope every single one of you watches Clay sing the heck out of the SSG this weekend, then sticks around for the game.

The NHL needs fans.  Clay is one, and we hope you will be too.  Apologies from us on behalf of anyone who treats your opinions with less than that respect.

Real Hockey Fan - You&#039;re welcome to comment again and make your point.  Please do so without being offensive.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Real hockey fan

My 80 year old mother probably knows more about hockey than you do.  Didn&#039;t know there was actually an age restriction to be hockey fans.

You wouldn&#039;t by any chance be a tad bit homophobic?  Are you sure you are old enough to be posting on the internet?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Let&#039;s see if I can post without insulting all sides of this debate.

I think that labeling Clay Aiken as a &quot;D-List&quot; celebrity is harsh and inaccurate.  I would, however, agree that he is most certainly a &quot;B-List&quot; celebrity.  But the thing is that Hockey is a &quot;B-List&quot; sport - hence the reason the All Star Game is on some relatively obscure cable channel rather than on NBC, CBS, ABC or even FOX,  and the reason you get The Canadian Tenors and not Michael Buble singing the Canadian National Anthem and you get 3 Doors Down and not Lady Gaga for the first break.

You also have a point about the NHL knowing their audience.  Clay Aiken is a kind soul who donates his time and name to many charities.  He has an amazing singing voice, a very quick wit and he&#039;s extremely intelligent.  He is very vocal about his love for his home town and his family.  You are right, he does not fit the demographic of the stereotypical Neanderthal hockey fan.

All of that being said, I have to applaud the NHL for making the choice that they did.  They had to know there would be a firestorm over their choice, but I feel they got what they wanted - publicity.  There are many people who did not even know the All Star game was this weekend who are now aware, including both Idol fans and Clay fans.  Many of them will tune in - some to hear Clay sing, some waiting (and probably hoping) for the hockey fans to live up to their reputation and give Clay a less than polite homecoming.  Clay Aiken will sing the hell out of the National Anthem and hopefully the crowd will respond accordingly.

I&#039;m not sure if I will be tuning in or not, we will see.]]></description>
