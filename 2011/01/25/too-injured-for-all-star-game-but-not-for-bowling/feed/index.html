		<description><![CDATA[OK, I&#039;ll give Geno the benefit of the doubt because I adore him and he probably got it from making out with Chuck. So Chuck should take care of him like a good dream girl-friend. Thank god I woke up before it went there but it was def. going THERE! LOL.

As for Sid, not back peddling on it. I feel like he&#039;s trying to get back at the NHL for not punishing Steckle after the fact.

There is alot Sid can do and SHOULD do as the touted &#039;golden boy&#039; of the NHL. He gets alot of &#039;extras&#039; for his position so along with it comes the added responsibility. If ya gonna play, ya gotta pay too. He can&#039;t have it both ways, but he certainly likes to try too.

But enuff. :) Kiss and make up. I get both your points. And none of us really know. What is REALLY important is that Kris will be there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sid had the most votes for the 2008 and 2009 All-Star Games too.  He couldn&#039;t play either year due to injuries but he still attended the events.  I think that proves he understands the importance of both the honor and the event.

But that doesn&#039;t matter.  Nothing that Sidney Crosby  does will ever be enough.

As for Malkin, he played vs Detroit on 1/18 - 15:50 to be exact, and had an assist.  That&#039;s the day AFTER the bowling event.  So his knee looked fine at bowling because it was fine at bowling.

If it&#039;s really sickness keeping him out the lineup the last two games, then it should be keeping him out of everything until he&#039;s fully recovered and back on the damned ice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Concussion is evil - he could be having good and bad days?! And what about Savvy - I is very distressed about his 2nd concussion of the year AND that it was a hit from Hunwick too!

Geno is a wuss tho. Bug wuss. But they have been saying Cros has good and bad times during the day. Just saying.]]></description>
