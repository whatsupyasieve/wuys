		<description><![CDATA[I just hate it! The Kings are not good enough to play that kind of game especially against The Bruins and Bergy who is a scoring machine.

Oh and last night at Staples was also Bean Pot night? Something about Boston area Alums and a big tournament... I figured you and Pants would know about that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That was a great fight.  Thornton is a beast.  He will mess you up, serve his penalty, then come out the box and score a goal.  He&#039;s got great hands for a brawler.  (7 goals so far this year, which is a career high)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I completely, completely agree. Football is actually my sport of choice and I see it in almost EVERY major game. Team&#039;s seem to relax and exert themselves only to maintain the lead. It is the most frustrating thing to watch. That&#039;s why so many huge play-off games become nail-biters in the end. Well, that and the team realizes that if they don&#039;t pick it up, their season is over. Still, you rarely see the same motivation and effort in the second half of a football game if the team is winning.]]></description>
