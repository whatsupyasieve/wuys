		<description><![CDATA[I got mad kitty ups.

I find goalie fights hysterical.  All that cumbersome equipment and straps and pads.  Even if they wanted to really fight, they can&#039;t.  Supposed they could strip off some of the gear but by that time, they&#039;d be too exhausted to fight.

I would love to see Flower pop Price in the mouth with his blocker, though. &quot;Oh my nose!&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chuck, as a kitten you are getting some serious air there.  I am impressed.  Just wait until Flower mocks Carey Price again, then they&#039;ll be dueling at center ice with all their gear on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I LOVE IT! Good job guys! Although my draft would have simply been Letang VS Ovechkin and left it at that. Who cares about the rest - JUST KIDDING. NOT. Anyway, hope to see y&#039;all on twitter this weekend. ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh god - I almost can&#039;t decide... Too hard... But... But.... My team players on one team plus LePretty may have to swing me to Team Chuck (sorry Pants), Staal sandwich potential notwithstanding. Even with Sad Panda on Pants&#039; team.

What would I have done if Sid and, god forbid, Baby Jordy had been up there? Die, probably.

Fidget will be proud of you both... He is the NHL&#039;s top slap-fighter!]]></description>
