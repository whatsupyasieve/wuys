		<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t agree with you more. I was upset because I don&#039;t get VERSUS so I has to watch the CBC version and let me tell you sister, it wasn&#039;t much better. However, Letang was redeemed by scoring TWO GOALS so he could not be ignored and he won his heat skating backwards with his AWESOME hair flowing in the wind! If you need more Letang, I suggest you go to the Pens site because there is AWESOME footage there. :) Sorry for your misery. But hey, you&#039;re in Europe! XXOO :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So first of all, love the blog.

Secondly, I&#039;m currently in Europe, six hours ahead.  I stayed up late to watch the ASG red carpet shit which NHL.com was kind enough to stream on their site.  I was so tired but I made myself stay awake, knowing that Letang can rock a suit like nobody&#039;s business.  And THEY DIDN&#039;T EVEN SHOW HIM.  Come on, NHL.com.  How can they look at how many votes he got and think, &quot;Nah, let&#039;s not show him on the red carpet.&quot;  Obviously Letang is an awesome player but let&#039;s not kid ourselves - a large portion of those votes were for his hair.  Why wouldn&#039;t they give the fans what we so obviously want?  Instead we get the incredibly awkward moment where they ask Dustin Byfuglien to rap.]]></description>
