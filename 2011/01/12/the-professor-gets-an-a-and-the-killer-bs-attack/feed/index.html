		<description><![CDATA[So pleased!  Bergy is also on one of my fantasy hockey teams so he got me mad points last night.
While I wish that more Bruins got an All-Star selection, I&#039;m sort of not surprised that they didn&#039;t.  The Bs don&#039;t really have superstars like the Pens or Caps or Hawks - they just have solid players who get it done.  But I agree - Bergy totes should have been voted it!
Savvy is so freaking adorable.  I want to put him in my pocket.  Oh don&#039;t worry, I&#039;ve already been planning the Savvy FF.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so pleased.  Are you pleased?  I think you are LOL.  We should so go to a game together the next time I&#039;m over.

I think it stinks only TIMMMMAAAAYYYYY and Chara were picked.  Ference should have been in there and so should Bergy.  Betcha loads of people are gonna kick themselves now. I say nothing of Looch and Savvy (I am calling him the BEAST from now on - have you SEEN that aggression???)

After all, how many players have had a hattie this season (aside from Sid almost every time he gets ice time)?

I feel a Sexy Savvy FF coming on. Whaddya reckon?

And it&#039;s you and me, Chuck, against the other two LOL!!]]></description>
