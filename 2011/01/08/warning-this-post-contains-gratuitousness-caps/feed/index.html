		<description><![CDATA[Dawn - I&#039;m just going to glare at you.  Not if Cro-Magnon was the last man alive and it was us reproduce or the human race dies out.  It would be extinction for us.  &#039;Nuff said.

REALLY!? Is it like a Foxy Friday? I mean, cause it&#039;s Brooks, baby.  It would like, have to be something of suitable awesomeness.  Which you know would have to run, like for weeks.  Because he is just THAT awesome.  Polite, good-looking, intelligent, camera-friendly, model-like good-looking (without being metro-sexual).  I can go on.....

And then there&#039;s those blue, blue eyes.  Which is why I call him Mr Blue-Blue Eyes.  Cause that&#039;s what he has.

If I ever meet him, I&#039;d get so giddy I&#039;d pass out.  And I don&#039;t pass out. EVER.

*Still not a Caps fan*]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If Brooksy is actually wearing eyeliner, he manages to make it look MANLY.  In fact I was well impressed that someone managed to get Fidget&#039;s hair under control.  Nice that most of the Ovi shots didn&#039;t actually show him. :D.

Brooksy didn&#039;t look dangerous, he just looked cool.  OK, so I am biased.  Actually they all looked kinda cool.

Except #8.  Sorry Dawn - I remain unconvinced by Cro-Magnon man.

Did I mention Brooksy looked both hot and cool as?  Just checking.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[BAH!  I laughed so hard I gave myself a headache.  This is intentionally hilarious and brilliant marketing, plus they look like they&#039;re having so much fun.  Is Laich wearing eyeliner?!  And Semin&#039;s rockstar hair?  This is like Hot Tub Time Machine to 2008.]]></description>
