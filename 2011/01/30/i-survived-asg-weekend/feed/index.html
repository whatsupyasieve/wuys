		<description><![CDATA[Every single NHL player needs media training.  With the exception of Tim Thomas.  Because he&#039;s awesome.

Matt Duchene&#039;s quote of the night - &quot;Did we get voted off the island?&quot;

Mikey was trying really hard not to blow bubbles up on stage.  What if he did and Staal popped with this finger?  Laugh for days.

Tim Thomas is old compared to the guys he was up there with.  But I don&#039;t think that he really cares.  He is just having a good time.

God Bless you, Verses cameraman. You managed to get long, lingering shots of every player&#039;s butt, and for this we thank you.

I love Squishy.

That&#039;s all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know this isn&#039;t a normal human reaction, but when Letang tripped up the stairs, I actually screamed. Clearly, I felt a bit protective. At least he made up for it today (and during his ridiculous backward skate race).

By the way, calling the Sedin twins &#039;aliens&#039; is the funniest thing I&#039;ve heard in a while. THANK YOU.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It was so magically delicious I was waiting for my pet lego sparkly Unicorn to fly out of Kris Letang&#039;s hair! But instead, it flew out of his stick to make two goals and a bromance with Ovi! What more could I have asked for this weekend! Jesus loves me!]]></description>
