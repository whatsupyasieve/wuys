		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been following this blog for little while but haven&#039;t commented yet. I HAD to comment on this post though, because I definitely believe being a college hockey fan is something special. I grew up watching Northern Michigan University and yelling at opposing refs and goalies [the time my dad stopped being &#039;that guy&#039; who yelled at goalies was when I started doing it at age 3 or 4, he didn&#039;t need me repeating what he said ;)], and now I do the same at the University of Michigan. I don&#039;t think there will ever be a time I don&#039;t follow college hockey!

We also do the &quot;Ugly Goalie&quot; chant, and when our goalie takes his mask off we chant &quot;Handsome Goalie&quot; and all go &quot;awww&quot; when he puts it back on. Just a little ego boost for them haha]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Brittany -
Thanks for the comment! It makes us all too happy to know that people other than our 5 friends read this blog.  If I am being honest, Miami (OH) deserved to win that game.  They played so well but Jack Parker and Terriers turned up to 11 when it really mattered and score those 2 quick goals.  I was at a bar near Fenway Park, standing in a corner, watching the game with a few friends.  When they won, we lost it.  Screaming, jumping, hugging.  It was magical.

Despite this victory, we still hope you continue to read our blog.  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Still can&#039;t get over that people actually listen to things that Kornacki says.  He&#039;s all important and junk.

Shannon and I certainly didn&#039;t listen to him when we ditch broomball for Westlife.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kornacki worked for Sasquatch at the Alumni Fund and quit his job to come to dinner at the GSU.  True story.  Then I impersonated Sasquatch on the phone (using a t-shirt over the mouthpiece to disguise my voice) in an effort to get him to come back to work.  It almost worked.  He&#039;s insanely gullible.

Now he&#039;s an important political analyst.  Joke&#039;s on me.

I hated sitting in Section 8 and having to stand the whole game.  And as much as I miss Sasquatch, I don&#039;t miss the idiot in the BC Sucks &#039;02 jersey who used to yell at the refs like he was at at EPL match.

P.S. I may look 12 in that picture but I&#039;m also 40 pounds lighter.  Advantage: 1997.]]></description>
