		<description><![CDATA[Oh I think there are dudes out there that will totally love this - it&#039;s just that I think it&#039;s hysterical that the person they went to is STAN LEE and the mystical trophy for hockey is the STANLEY CUP. Because that was all I hear now when they run those commercials and Mr. Cherrie won&#039;t let it go now!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dude, totally.  This produces the same glazed-over look as when we start talking about World of Warcraft.  But I checked with my dorksquad brother, and he thinks it&#039;s totally cool.  So... Shane is broke and I don&#039;t see how that gets the NHL anything. ;)]]></description>
