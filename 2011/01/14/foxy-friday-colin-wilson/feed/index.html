		<description><![CDATA[During the Hobey Baker award ceremony in 2009 they did a whole background story thing on Wilson and it made me love him that much more.

He&#039;s a definite cutie and I&#039;m always giddy to see him when the Preds come to town. Our little group, of 3 BU alums, gets super excited for the &quot;enemy&quot; but we don&#039;t care--gotta represent BU first and foremost!]]></description>
