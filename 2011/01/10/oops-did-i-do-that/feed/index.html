		<description><![CDATA[Forgot something....

TIMMMMMAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYY!

Do love.  Met him last year.  He&#039;s AWESOME!  Told him I thought his medal was the wrong color, but if ANYONE tells Sid/Bergy/Blue-Blue-Eyes/Team Canada/Canadian Immigration that I will deny it.  I was honestly supporting Team Canada.  I have the BELIEVE hat to prove it... But he looked just...just...just so saaaad when I mentioned the medal.  Become Canadian Timmy!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am kind of stoked about the love of my life...sorry...stalkee...nope, still not right...FAVORITE HOCKEY PLAYER scoring both of those goals :D.  Cass LOVES.

Still can&#039;t believe we gave away a 2 goal lead though.  But weirdly is hurt less that if it was, say, the Caps, or worse, the F*****s.]]></description>
