Unless I see Mr Blue-Blue Eyes.  Then I&#039;m in there with you playing cards until they deport me and never allow me in the country again... :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mr. Pants is not on Twitter - I think my running commentary is quite enough for him in real life.

I&#039;ve seen Sid and the Pens 5 times now and managed to hold it together.  Mostly.  It almost got criminal in Atlanta. ;)

I&#039;ll have to do okay in DC or it&#039;ll be the Homeland Security holding cell for me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thx for the shoutout - I just thought it needed to be brought to your attention forthwith.

Is Mr Pants on Twitter? I ask because I think those of us who know and love you Pants would love the running commentary of you climbing the barriers and heading out onto the ice after Fidget...:D

I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be fine tho - I&#039;ve seen the Bruins twice, once right next to the glass and I managed not to leap over and tackle Bergy.  Although I did get some awesome ass shots.  And I am still sure he dropped to the ice about 12 foot in front of me ON PURPOSE.

Love Fidget&#039;s smile.  *Big girly sigh*.  And although I am gutted, I&#039;m actually kinda stoked Brooks has a GF.  He had such a lovely smile on his face as he skated with her hand in hand.  It was an awwww moment.  I can be magnanimous.

And one of these days, it&#039;ll be you and me going to DC for games.  Any games.  Things are going well with Mr Md!!]]></description>
