		<description><![CDATA[I meant MAX TALBOT&#039;S lack of fashion sense generally. Obviously. Sorry if I inadvertently offended EVERYONE reading this blog if they thought I was talking to them.

		<description><![CDATA[I was so sad about losing Rupp that I came in here to look at pretty pictures of Letang.  It helped.  Talbot is easier for me to say goodbye to.  He&#039;s a great guy but I don&#039;t think he&#039;s going to get any better on the Pens.  He needs to go somewhere else, shake things up, find a system where he can be more effective.  But the Flyers?  And all of the shit he&#039;s said about them over the years?  Yikes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, me again.  Will someone explain to me exactly what the Pens strategy is for the coming season? Comedy hockey?

No offense, but having got rid of two stalwart team players and with their stars not confirmed as coming off LTIR for October, just what is going on?

I mean I&#039;m a die-hard Killer B fan, but I hold a soft spot for the Pens.  Well I did.  Now it&#039;s down to Flower, LePretty and Sidney]]></description>

It&#039;s a sad, sad day. And I agree, I probably will under stand it sometimes, but when...no one knows. Honestly any other team would have been better, literally any other.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Despite your (lacking) fashion sense and Couturier (Rookie of my Life) now both about to take on the orange, it&#039;s just not going to happen.  I can&#039;t.  IT DOES NOT COMPUTE.

Bet someone in the Pens offices is feeling a bit stupid now. He got a much better deal.

PANTS: CHECK YOUR EMAIL!!! TRIP ALERT!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t understand this at ALL!! Thought he was going to go for more. Seriously thought he&#039;d have gone to Chicago or Toronto - hell, I&#039;d be cool with him in Vancouver even, but Philly? And now Rupper&#039;s going to the Rangers?? Sad day to be a Pens fan. I need a Sid appearance to make it better. :(]]></description>
