		<description><![CDATA[Thank GOD they didn&#039;t bring back Jagr. I know I might be the only Pens fans saying this, but after he got $3.3 million with Philly, clear he didn&#039;t really want to come back to the &#039;Burgh. And now we get TK for a better price, longer timeline and a younger player. Wins all around!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m thrilled, really.  Shows the Pens are looking ahead to the long future, not just focusing on the coming season.  They believe Kennedy can contribute more than he has in the past, and I agree.  His experience playing through all of the Penguins&#039; injuries last year is going to make him a better player.]]></description>
