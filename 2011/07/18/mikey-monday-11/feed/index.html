		<description><![CDATA[He&#039;s back to DC!! He and John Carlson are building a KaBOOM playground today (one of DC&#039;s HOTTEST DAYS EVER) which just means I have 6 weeks to find him and become BFFs before the season starts (&#039;cause you know, it&#039;s hard to start a BFF relationship on the road).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry guys, the Mike sightings have been mostly relegated to the Stampede! Which I did not go to this year - the thought of deep fried Coca-Cola and a ring check was enough to turn my stomach. This weekend I&#039;m going to the &quot;lake&quot; (we like artificial lakes here in Calgary) and fingers crossed I&#039;ll see Greener! Your Calgary correspondent will be better. :)]]></description>
