		<description><![CDATA[:D. I was in this room at a function last year. I am staring, open-mouthed at this LARGE piece of silverwear on a table and people are getting pics taken of them with it. So I say: &quot;That...that&#039;s not what I think it is,...is it?&quot;

This older guy, wearing this Bruins jersey with a 4 on it (I think he might have been famous or something LOL *winks*) turns to me and says: &quot;well yes, ma&#039;am, yes it is.&quot;

*very bad words said here*

It&#039;s very, very impressive close up. And shiny. I like SHINY.]]></description>
