		<description><![CDATA[Why hello there, Mr. Sexy Legs.

What a coincidence! I recently received my Beverage Cart driver&#039;s license, so I am totally prepared for this adventure.

Vroom vroom, boys.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I also feel unkindly towards the one great sport developed in my native country of Scotland (as most of us emigrated to Canada back in the 19th, it&#039;s no surprise those guys love it too. I&#039;ll just have to put up with it when I emigrate *rolls eyes*).

But I&#039;d so pay big bucks to go watch the tournament. Very. Nice. Views. *cue sighing*

PS I am not sure whether or not I have a sneaking suspicion that Ice Hockey is, in fact, Shinty (also Scottish) on ice. It is far more violent than hockey. I rest my case.  When does hockey season start again? Are we there yet?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank God you posted this. I&#039;m having a fangirl freakout up here in the great white north. Seriously, are you seeing those calves? Amazing. Unlike his Breakfast Television interview - are we a sleepy puppy or does Jon get more boring in the summer.

There&#039;s also these photos from Twitter, clearly taken from a watch camera:

Toews being auctioned off (good Lord why was I not in Winnipeg last night): http://yfrog.com/khdbfgbj and Autographing at the event: http://yfrog.com/kh8tekj

I&#039;m with you, Pants. I&#039;m no golfer but I&#039;d gladly drive the beer cart around the course for free.]]></description>
