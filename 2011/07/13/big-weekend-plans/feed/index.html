		<description><![CDATA[I figured if I died, I needed to take you guys with me!! I want a really cool nickname too...

BTW, I actually live in Raleigh, NC so I can keep Intern Jeff Skinner in line for you. That may be one of the hardest jobs I may ever have...other than staring at JT all weekend....serious eye candy folks, although Brent Seabrook and Kyle Beach weren&#039;t too harsh on the eyes either!

The Hawks convention is a MUST for any Hawks fan. They know how to do it up. The only part I didn&#039;t like was all the waiting in line, but the discussion panels were worth it. This was sort of a homecoming for me in a way. I used to live in Norfolk, VA where the Hawks&#039; AHL farm team was located so I know several of the players/management on the team (Duncan Keith, Brent Seabrook, Corey Crawford, Mike Haviland, Al MacIsaac, and Mark Bernard). I was able to talk to all of them and hang with Al and Bernie on Sat night. Even if you don&#039;t attend all the festivities, being in Chicago is a treat in of itself.

I will have pics of Intern Jeff Skinner this season as I have Canes season tickets.!

		<description><![CDATA[Ok...first day of the convention was spent waiting...a lot of waiting! The opening ceremonies introduced past and present Hawks with of course Toews being the last one introduced. I didn&#039;t think he could look yummier...until I saw him during his radio interview. I was right in front of him and took so many pictures! How do I post them here? He then went down the line and signed so I was able to get my Toews jersey signed...I gave him my sharpie which he then proceeded to keep it! I think a private meeting for him to return it to me is in order! I have so many pics to share...how do I get them on the site?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Veronica!  We want your pictures, stories and preferably close encounters.  Derp faces appreciated, and if you get your own picture with JT, there may be some jealous weeping among our loyal readership.  So far the closest we&#039;ve come was when @jfrancesw bumped his elbow.

And of course any hockey news, fun things the Hawks have planned for &#039;11-&#039;12 and hugs from Joey.  Big hugs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cassy, this is for you - I&#039;m your one-stop-shop for Toews sightings.

The Hawks posted this video from the tournament yesterday - yes, Tazer&#039;s rambling requires the mute button but they follow him along in my ultimate fangirling stalking: http://video.blackhawks.nhl.com/videocenter/console?catid=894&#038;id=120738 Tazer&#039;s all awkward big brother with his caddy - adorbs.

The lesson here? I don&#039;t think I&#039;d ever want to play anything with JT (wait, let me think about that). Certainly not golf or a board game. Jon slams his club into the rough on almost every hole - good thing his name is on the tournament &#039;cuz I&#039;m sure he would have gotten kicked off the course otherwise.

Also - agreed, wonderful choice from JToews on the wardrobe - you can find more photos here from someone who was at the tournament: http://lzbth-trn.blogspot.com/2011/07/day-on-green-with-jonathan-toews.html

Am so in for that slumber party. I&#039;ll bring the Mexi-Colas if you guys bring the Ben &#038; Jerry&#039;s. (Accepting no substitutes). I&#039;d bring my copy of Miracle, but wrong region.

Why isn&#039;t Mystery, Alaska on that list &#038; are the rumors Intern Jeff Skinner is doing sponsored foot rubs also true? :D]]></description>
