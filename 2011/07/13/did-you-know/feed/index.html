		<description><![CDATA[My two cents...Crosby will get mega bucks to stay otherwise Pittsburgh will riot and I guarantee that the degree of anger in that event will be so high that there will be a strict NO MAKING OUT IN THE STREETS policy (Thanks, Vancouver). I don&#039;t really see how they could possibly keep Staal and Malkin and honestly, at this point in time, I&#039;d rather have Staal. Sorry Geno, but the T-Rex is more consistant and heals faster.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great. Now, I&#039;ve worked myself into a frenzy.

I thought it was hard when Max and Rupper left this year. I&#039;m not worried about Sid - he IS Pittsburgh and Mario could never part with him. But, Geno? Staalsy? What would I even do without them?

I need that beautiful blonde butt chin. I need those adorable Russian-isms (ex. &quot;Big taste.&quot; &quot;New season, new team.&quot;).

I know this is premature, but can we have prayer circles? Sacrifices to the hockey gods? Group counseling? I can&#039;t do this alone.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jorrrrrrrrrrrdaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!

(Sorry, was that hysterical?  Because that&#039;s how I feel.  Sid&#039;s in the bag, even if they have to give him the entire team.  Geno, well, Geno is Geno.  He&#039;s incredible except when he&#039;s not and to be honest, I wouldn&#039;t give him $7.5 - 9 mill/year for any longer without more consistency.

But Jordan.  Jordan could be the Brad Richards of the year he UFAs and I just don&#039;t want to see him end up somewhere else.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I honestly was shocked. Why go through all that trouble to get the first round draft pick of Sidney Crosby and not build a dynasty around him? Unbelievable to me. You have mad talent on this team and looking at that chart they are all about to walk unless you come up with some serious cash that you would not have had to pay out had you tied them to some long term contacts. Bad business. I tell ya. Bad business. Even Letang only got a four year contract I believe - 12 or 14 million which is good for him but still. He works hard, he&#039;s proved himself and he keeps getting better.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ughhh....this makes me throw up.

I knew about this, but I hate to think about it. Shero isn&#039;t a long-term deal guy (everyone seems to sign for 1 or 2 years), but still. I love Crosby, Geno, and Staalsy. Too much.

I have a horrible feeling that we&#039;ll lock down Sid and lose Staalsy...say it ain&#039;t so.]]></description>
