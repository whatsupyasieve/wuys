		<description><![CDATA[Um .. I think I don&#039;t need a shirt. I&#039;ll just wear  Drew&#039;s or Ovi&#039;s when I sleep over! hahahah! ;) No, I think Drew def needs a pay hike but maybe a reality check. Dean won&#039;t pay up because he only believes in paying for performance and unfortunately, he didn&#039;t quite perform this year which is a total bummer after coming off such a great year with the Olympics. But highest paid is a bit much with Kopitar and his constant performance. Now with Gagne, he will have some competition too! I agree! But Drew is will always be the hottest King and that body he has going on right now ----- OMG! I&#039;ll sit on him while he does crunches and feed him his donuts!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Puhleese, if owners are throwing money around, I think little Drew deserves his share. James Wisniewski is making 7 million, and he&#039;s never been touched by God. Plus, we can see by the video that Drew can&#039;t even afford a golf bag.

That t-shirt is only owned by Drew and Ovie? I think Dawn needs one too, so she can be in that very special club, with only three members, and regular all-night meetings in high end hotels...whew.]]></description>
