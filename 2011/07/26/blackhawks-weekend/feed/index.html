		<description><![CDATA[I had so much fun taking these pics! I was elated to see this post...thanks for all the props! The derp photo came at the end of JT telling a story about how him and Kaner had gotten into it on the bench because Kaner wouldn&#039;t pass JT the puck. He finally did, JT scores, and we end up with that face as he tells Kaner, &quot;I told you so...&quot; Of course JT&#039;s response wasn&#039;t as cordial so I kept it G-rated for Jeff Skinner and our &quot;younger&quot; readers.

I have a ton more photos from the All-star game (including several of intern Jeff Skinner) that you guys are more than welcome to use. How can I get them to you?

I think we need to send Intern Jeff Skinner on a mission to find some Chicago deep dish pizza...I would so give him bite-size snickers if he did...]]></description>

Also, that is the most precious derp ever. Nice camera work :P (And I&#039;m totally one of the ones freakin&#039;... Guilty as charged! But honestly. She&#039;s objectively orange.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kudos to you for the classiness re: the lady Jon brought to the baseball game. People are freakin&#039; and I think it&#039;s good that Cappy is taking a girl on dates! Our little boy&#039;s growing up, ladies. Dawncherrie herself said her summer wish for Tazer was for him to get laid - I agree. Job well done, Johnny.

But anyways - back to the convention. Veronica, you&#039;re my hero. These photos....sigh. The weekend was an UNBELIEVABLE fangirl overload - including when Patrick Sharp convince JToews to tap his own bum. EEEEK! Video found here, forward to the 40 minute mark:  http://video.blackhawks.nhl.com/videocenter/console?catid=894&#038;id=120923

Plus JOEY was at the convention! Love this guy - what a ham!  http://video.blackhawks.nhl.com/videocenter/console?catid=894&#038;id=120908

Is it October yet??]]></description>
