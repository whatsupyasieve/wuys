		<description><![CDATA[Yup. Yup and er, yup. Cassy agrees to all of that, although both Chuck &#038; Pants both know I fan-girl all over my team probably enough for legions of fans. On both sides of the Atlantic.

Ps the Xmas presents to myself of Bruins scrubs (I went there) and winter hat are working out just fine :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is alot to be said for the power of thought.  If you want it bad enough, often times it is going to happen.  You will yourself into the zone where no one and no team is going to stand in your way.

They have their pretty goal moments, like Marchand&#039;s the other night and Bergeron&#039;s vs. the Flyers, but all in all they just grind it out and take advantages of the opportunity presented them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Being a Leafs fan, know this is tough for me to say but the Bruins certainly are the best in the league for all the reasons you listed. They aren&#039;t the pretty goals types. They are gritty and play with passion. I seriously think they won the cup because they wanted it more. The play the type of hockey Leaf fans (or fans who know the game) admire. The type Gilmour or Wendel Clark are revered for here. Having great by that I mean the best goalies doesn&#039;t hurt either.]]></description>
