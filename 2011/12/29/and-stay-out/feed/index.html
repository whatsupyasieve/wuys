		<description><![CDATA[Why everyone hates Jagr:(:(? If he want money, he can stay in KHL, where he earned more than 7 millions per year. He just wanted to try playing in NHL again, no matter where. Pittsburgh Penguins didn&#039;t want him, so he is in Philly now.

I always will be pens fan, but I think fans which want to boo him, are f. stupid...

I am Czech and all Czechs loves him:D...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Even tho he now wears orange MAX TALBOT is still sexy. It&#039;s that look in the ads. The mean panty-melting look. That makes me want to go party in Philly just to hear that accent (and we know I&#039;m not a fan of that town AT ALL).

He so sexy. Dammit.]]></description>
