		<description><![CDATA[As if Patrick Sharp couldn&#039;t be cuter, what with that hair and those teeth, now he has to be the guy with that hair, those teeth AND a beautiful baby. I bet he even makes little dribbles of drool on his shoulder look cute.

*Please excuse me while my ovaries implode in advance of said photos*]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks a lot guys... now I&#039;m having mildly disturbing fantasies about Tazer being *my* babysitter...

You are not allowed to use the words &quot;Tazer&quot; and &quot;ride&quot; in the same sentence. Death ensues.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tazer would be a fun babysitter?? Kane is DEFINITELY more fun!!
Pat would probably let you build couch cushion forts and let you stay up past your bedtime.
Tazer is probably a huge fan of the quiet game and then only one book at bedtime.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a photo of Sharp with his baby, apologies in advance as he has NEVER looked more handsome: yfrog.com/kfzludjj

I cannot handle the cute of hockey players having babies. It&#039;s weakening my defences against not having kids. Patrick Sharp is the most beautiful of all DILFs (obviously) and that photo of Tazer reading is the sweetest thing EVER.

Plus - Joey the Jr. Reporter was back in the Hawks locker room on Saturday - if he talks to Sharp about his baby I&#039;m gonna die...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is anyone else concerned that the ginger kid on Toew&#039;s left looks JUST LIKE INTERN JEFF SKINNER!?  That is freaky.

Toews would be a perfect babysitter - he&#039;d cut the crust off bread and mow the lawn just for fun.  But I don&#039;t know about the Hokey Pokey.  I think that&#039;s Seabrook territory.

And yes, I picture Kaner getting dolled up like ET by some little girl who&#039;s too cute to say no to.]]></description>
