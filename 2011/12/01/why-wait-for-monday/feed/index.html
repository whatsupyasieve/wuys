		<description><![CDATA[Seriously, Michael.
Please stop.
I cannot take all this sexy time.
Also, I&#039;m surprisingly  okay with the Spanish Conquisator moustache he&#039;s got going on.  Mucho gusto, Miguel.

I know Pants is not into the tattoos but I happen to LOVE THEM!  He&#039;s trying so hard to be bad ass when we all know he&#039;s just a smooshy panda.]]></description>
