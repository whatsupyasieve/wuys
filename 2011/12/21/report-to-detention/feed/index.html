Yeah, sorry Engo, but could have been avoided.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had a meltdown when Tanger got hit by Pacioretty and I was screaming FIVE games, but I think the three he got was fair.  But I agree with you, it should have been an avoided head shot, and it sure looked like he came off his feet.  Engo will have to answer for that.  It has to be fair across the board even if it is one of the Pens.  The rules have to apply to every player and each team:)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was there I was there I WAS THEREEEEEE.

I actually thought Kruger was at fault, but who knows. It was a great fight so I&#039;m not really arguing (although definitely unnecessary roughness on Scott&#039;s end). Engo always knows how to work a busted eyebrow. :]]]></description>
