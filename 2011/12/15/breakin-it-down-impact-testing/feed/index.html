		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for taking the time to post and share this with us, Chuck! Concussions are not to be taken lightly, and this post just emphasizes that even more for us who aren&#039;t/weren&#039;t aware of how simple things like recognizing shapes, words and letters can be taken for granted.

&#039;Hoping and praying that all the players who&#039;ve been diagnosed recover, not even quickly, but well and up to their 100% best. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think they did a version of this with me when I had my concussion nearly 20 years ago!

Those of you who know me will know that I&#039;m totally in favour of the cautious approach to head injuries - and it&#039;s not because of my mad love for Savard. Being a nurse and my own experience of it has taught me this.

Concussion is dangerous. It can be life altering. Better to be safe than sorry and here&#039;s hoping all the boys are back fighting fit soon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re welcome, Li Li. Thanks for the kind words.

It makes us sad that so many players are going down with concussions this year, but we&#039;re happy that the league and teams are taking it all so seriously.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oy the third section makes me so scared.  Imagine looking right at that stuff and not being able to process it?  THREE LETTERS?  Precisely why players should take all the time they need and more to recover, because there&#039;s no way you live any part of a normal life outside the game if you can&#039;t perform those tasks.

PS: Jeff.  My heart is breaking.  Please be okay.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As an athletic trainer who uses this test almost daily, I just want to say thanks for this post. This test has improved the care of my athletes (and thousands all over) dramatically and prevented some serious and potential life long effects. And in the end...that is all that matters, yanno?

Not that I don&#039;t wish these guys a speedy recovery and all...I&#039;m just saying I get the conservative treatment plans. And it&#039;s not terrible to see them in suits.]]></description>
