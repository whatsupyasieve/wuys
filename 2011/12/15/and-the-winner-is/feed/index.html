		<description><![CDATA[I totally agree about voting for the players who ARE playing.  I voted all Pens and Neal and Fleury got my votes plus I had two write-ins, one forward and one D-man. I love, love, love Sidney and I want him back, but I don&#039;t think its fair to some of the Pens&#039; other great forwards if Sidney gets the vote but can&#039;t play.  Fans want to see them!  I&#039;m gaining a lot of respect for Toews, too. Flower seems to just go with the flow when the line up is like a revolving door!  Phew... long winded. haha  Love reading your posts and tweets:D]]></description>
