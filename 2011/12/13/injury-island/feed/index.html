		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Kate!  We&#039;re glad you found us.  Keep reading!

It&#039;s not that we hate the Canucks...it&#039;s just that we don&#039;t like them as much as we like the other teams.  But we do like Ryan Kesler.  He&#039;s nice.

Excellent googlesearch, btw.  Letang is featured quite alot on this site.  Mostly by DawnCherrie, who is in LURVE with him.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[All these injuries have killed my holiday spirit...and my fantasy teams.  No, seriously, do you know how many of these guys are on my teams?!  My bench and IR spaces are filling at a rate comparable to the number of Kleenex I&#039;ve tossed in the trash in the last hour.  I&#039;m contemplating changing my team names to &quot;The Concussed&quot; and &quot;The Other Injury Ninjas&quot;.

Personal safety bubbles for everyone this holiday season!! (I&#039;d ask you to start Intern Jeff Skinner on this project, but I&#039;m afraid he&#039;ll injure himself worse)]]></description>
