*falls over*

Thank you, NHL, for finally showing the Professor some love.  He is more than deserving.

Now if we can get more people to vote for him for the All-Star game....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I will be finding a way to steam this off the internet since I am a loser an do not have cable.
FINALLY Patty is at the center of attention.
I find no need to muffle my screams. Who cares if I scare the cats and neighbors. After all, my license plate reads: brgrn37

Happy birthday to me. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[AAAAAAUUUUUUGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!
This had BETTER be shown in Canada - the Professor is from the Great White North, after all!
Fingers crossed this episode is better than PKane&#039;s NHL 36 - complete with shots of him eating nachos, a cold sore on his lip and over-gelled hair. Not. Good.]]></description>
