		<description><![CDATA[Hey, Joey.  You&#039;re awesome.  Can you be our mascot?

Do we know how to pick Foxy Fridays or what?  Sweet baby Jesus in heaven - those eyelashes.  I would murder someone for those.  But instead I make due with my $20 Shu Uemura eyelash curler ( best invention evah ) and Dior mascara.

Toews&#039; bum is a Christmas miracle.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ask and you shall receive: http://video.blackhawks.nhl.com/videocenter/console?catid=36&#038;id=144007

Right around the 3:42 mark... I mean, this is a lovely piece on the wonderful things the Blackhawks organization does for the community. (It actually is! I am for once being sincere!)

The whole BHTV Christmas special was gold. There was also a bit on their strength and conditioning coach who has the*HARDESTJOB IN THE WHOLE WORLD* and on teenage Sharp looking so very Edward Cullen in his prom tux.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lindsay and my exact conversation from last night:

Me: &quot;JESUS HIS EYELASHES&quot;
L: &quot;His eyelashes are making me SO JEALOUS. Damn it Viktor!&quot;

Also - Jonathan Toews owns that shirt in black as well, which he wears to match his Nike boxer briefs as modelled casually in the &quot;Make A Wish&quot; segment of BHTV. Fitting, as I wish for him to be in his boxer briefs every day. Merry Christmas indeed.]]></description>
