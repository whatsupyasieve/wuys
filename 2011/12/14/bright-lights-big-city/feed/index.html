		<description><![CDATA[Last year&#039;s 24/7 turned me soft on the Pens (as a Flyers/Caps fan, that statement alone could get me mauled in Philadelphia)...so far, this season isn&#039;t doing much to make me love the Rangers.  Except Henrik...and Brian Boyle.  You can stick a bow on either one of them and place them under my tree :)]]></description>
