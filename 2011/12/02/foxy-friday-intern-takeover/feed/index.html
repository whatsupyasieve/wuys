1 - suggest you review the mandatory assertiveness training policy for interns STAT. Intern Jeff is showing alarming signs of making a bid for office domination. Or possibly world domination, which, let&#039;s face it, would be easier! And/or...

2 - suggest you check the levels of your secret stash of Mexi-colas, as his behaviour is suggestive of a rampant sugar high which cannot be explained away by the disappearance of the Watchamacallit bar stash.
