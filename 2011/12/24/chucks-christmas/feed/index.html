		<description><![CDATA[Best. Christmas. Evah.

Bruins put on a show.  Granted Panthers had played in Ottawa the night before and might have been a little tired, but the Bs were all over them.  Like Santa on milk and cookies.  They were unstoppable.  Brad Marchand aka &quot;Little Ball of Hate&quot; is a talented kid.

I highly encourage everyone to watch the Bs play sometime.  They are solid. As a rock. http://youtu.be/HzBfJOUEG1U?t=39s]]></description>
