		<description><![CDATA[Tim Thomas is the bomb dot com. He was my ASG vote for goalie all the way. Also, I suppose I can let him have the goalie awards. And sure, why not, also that weird one where marines repell from the ceiling of a Vegas casino. Pretty sure they only give that one to Americans anyway :P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, captain, my captain indeed. More Toews stats: he&#039;s first in goals, second in points, second in game winning goals, 17.7% in shorts, first in face-off wins with more than SIXTY-TWO PERCENT (including winning 88% last night), and first in beast mode. So much Jonny love makes me SO HAPPY!]]></description>
