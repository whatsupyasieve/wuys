		<description><![CDATA[Sorry I&#039;m late everyone. I got some blue markers for Jeff at Staples on my way, but I was perusing the emergency agenda and then got stuck trying to do the math on the Steel Cage Death Match and then got side-tracked thinking of Bruins v Pens and/or Flyers.

		<description><![CDATA[Definitely a big shakeup by the league.  Overall, this is a better balance for more teams than the old system.  The big winners here are Detroit, Dallas and Columbus.  Detroit gets to play more games against mid-west time zone teams (which means more people watching at a decent hour).  Dallas also gets to avoid so many crazy games out of time zone, etc.  Columbus gets a much better shot at making the playoffs, which is of primary importance to that club.

However, you are overlooking perhaps the biggest benefit of the new system in terms of the playoffs.  Assuming that there will be a re-seeding of teams based on points once you get the &quot;final four&quot; teams playing for the cup, depending on how that is done, you could end up with Bruins - Flyers for the Stanley cup...or Bruins - Rangers...or Bruins Penguins...or Edmonton - Detroit...or Rangers - Canadiens.  The possibility of those finals is very exciting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[SO MUCH PENGUINS VS. CAPITALS.  Extremely happy Pants may have been controlling this with her mind.  Random concessions were made in other conferences to accommodate as much Sid/Staal/Nealmobile/Flower/SexHair vs. Pooh/Piglet/Carlzner/Brooksy as possible.  Sorry to you all for the inconvenience.

And hey, Florida&#039;s only a 3 hour flight.  One trip, two teams, plus it&#039;s a hell of a lot warmer than Ottawa in January.  I&#039;d be loving that setup.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I suspect they were doing their best to keep the rivalries together - Chicago/Detroit, Boston/Montreal, Rangers/Flyers, Pens/Flyers (seriously, who doesn&#039;t have a rivalry with Philly?), Montreal/Toronto, Pens/Caps. But feel like the Islanders and Devils could have replaced Florida and Tampa.

Thank god Vancouver and Chicago aren&#039;t in the same conference. There&#039;s no way I could stand to see them play six times a season. It&#039;s bad enough they could someday play against each other FOR THE CUP. If that happens I&#039;m taking the entire series off from work and sequestering myself somewhere safe.]]></description>

I&#039;ve heard speculation that it was done to boost ticket sales in the lesser markets (i.e Florida and Tampa) by hosting more Canadian teams, thus appealing to the &quot;snow birds.&quot; (aka the canadians who come down to spend the winters in FL&#039;s toastiness) How boston got lumped in there, I&#039;m not entirely sure.]]></description>
