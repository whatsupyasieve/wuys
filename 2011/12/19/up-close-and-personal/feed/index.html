		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s true. He looks like a horse, my friends have given him the nickname &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; but there&#039;s something about him. I don&#039;t know what it is.

I was at this game. My friend and I traded in our Oilers jerseys for our Toews and Kane shirts, and then facepalmed the entire game.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s like your brain looks at him and thinks &quot;Not good&quot; but your hormones say otherwise. You stare at it confused...knowing you shouldn&#039;t find him attractive...but you do.

Jess should also be rewarded with being able to NOTICE the other team when the Hawks are playing. When I was in Chicago she texted me &quot;Is Taylor Hall hot?&quot; Sorry, can&#039;t see anything when Tazer&#039;s in front of me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Taylor Hall is hot. He shouldn’t be – he looks like an orangutan and a goldfish had a baby.&quot;

This is true.

But I&#039;m confused as to how you find this attractive....]]></description>
