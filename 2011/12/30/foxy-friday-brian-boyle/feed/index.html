		<description><![CDATA[24/7 is cruel. It made me not hate the Pens last year, and while I will always hate the Flyers, I definitely hate the Rangers a lot less now. I feel like a traitor.

Also, I very much enjoyed seeing my Michigan boys beat BC on Thursday night. BC sucks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[24/7 is very tricksy. Not only did it make me like the ego laden Ovi, but it made me fall in love with the extremely charming Max Talbot. This year I have fallen under the spell of Brian &quot;Buddy&quot; Boyle and I now think Claude Giroux is kinda hot.

Is it too early to wish that my Blackhawks were to be in the Winter Classic once again? After their hilarious Christmas video I would love to see what goes on in their locker room.  Beautiful Sharpie, intense Toews, no filter Bolland, Kaner (no explanation needed)..... I would just love to see 24/7 capture those guys. Hawks and Canucks kinda hate each other and it would make for great tv.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[THANK YOU!!!!! (I don&#039;t even know if you saw it but I asked for this on twitter forever ago...haha)

I HATE that he is a Rag...but I LOOOVED watching him in Manchester (and LA). And (Sorry, Pants and Chuck) I loved him as an Eagle. I was never anything but a UNH fan until I went to the regionals one year and he scored the winning goal in OT against the team that had beat UNH the day before...whose goalie was Al Montoya...and I can&#039;t stand him...so I looked Boyle up, and omg HOT!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You guys say what I&#039;m thinking, and in the most hilarious ways possible! I&#039;m a diehard caps fan and thanks to HBO I have a crush on Gingeroux (love your name for him) and he&#039;s my oldest daughter&#039;s age! How unseemly is THAT?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Absolute mind f*ckery on the part of HBO. Clearly the producers of 24/7 are all women destined to make our hormones go crazy - did you see how many beautiful men + children were in Episode 3? Stop it.

I vote for the Rangers Foxy Friday hattie - next week, Brand Prust. MMMMMMMMM,]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are not alone, Chuck!  While I will admit (under duress as a Caps and Flyers fan) that last year&#039;s 24/7 made me love the Pens, this year&#039;s series has only warmed my feelings toward a few Rangers.  I&#039;ve been blabbing on and on about Boyle for weeks and his Buddy the Elf impression just tipped the scales into adoration.  I find myself torn between wanting to jump the man and going to Mass to ask his parents to adopt me (what&#039;s one more?!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[13 kids?! Holy schnikies.  I thought Mama Staal was impressive.

I support this choice, Chuck. When you stand up at the front of the room and admit you like a Ranger, I will be there for you.  As long as this meeting has free cookies.

His Eddie Cahill-ness alone makes him worthy of this blog.  For the first these words were uttered, they were directed at Eddie: &quot;What&#039;s up, ya sieve?&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[24/7 is just propaganda! I am having the same twisted feelings! I want to hang out with these guys, and I find myself rooting for them!!! It is not logical! I can only hope that if HBO does this again next year that they dont pick teams that I absolutely HATE so that I can stop the Jedi mind tricks and just enjoy the show!!!]]></description>
