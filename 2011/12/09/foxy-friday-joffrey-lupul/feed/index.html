		<description><![CDATA[I tried to nominate Matt Niskanen for foxy Friday, but my email to you guys kept bouncing back as undeliverable!!  Anyway, since most of the Pens D is out, I&#039;ve be fixated on Nisky, especially since he put the beat down on Marchand Tuesday nite (sorry I know you&#039;re Boston fans) LOL!  But maybe you&#039;d keep him in mind for the future Friday installments.  I&#039;m not familiar with a lot of other players from around the NHL, but this guy-WOW.  Hott guy + guitar=swoon:D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Loops is an excellent choice, Chuck.  I liked him in Anaheim and hated the way that ended - they pretty much waited for him to get valuable again and shipped him out the second they could get a dollar for him.  BOOOO.  Anyway, he seems happy with the Leafs and he scores some very pretty goals.]]></description>
