		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Shit, Mom is going to kill us.&quot; Love it.

As someone currently experiencing a concussion, I CANNOT imagine what hockey players go through. Seriously, I&#039;ve been lying in the dark for the last 24 hours almost going insane. How you&#039;d do it for 10 months like Sid did is incredible.

And knowing there&#039;s something that could prevent some pretty major injuries - like visors - and players refuse is ridiculous. I appreciate that the Flyers&#039; doc wouldn&#039;t clear Pronger to play unless he committed to wearing a visor. The time is now - ignore Don Cherry. Half of Canada can&#039;t stand him, anyway.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seconded, thirded and one millioned. I would go a step further and suggest the mandatory face cages. I remember a few weeks ago, I was &quot;watching&quot; the Hawks game on Twitter and nearly for reals cried when they said Jonathan Toews - who does where a visor, THANK THE LORD - had left the bench after taking a puck to the face. In an exception to the &quot;I can&#039;t have nice things&quot; law of the universe, he literally took it on the chin LIKE A BOSS.

In closing, missing teeth, broken noses and other far more horrible injuries should become a thing of the past. Hockey players... Mmmm... So handsome.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[NOT THE FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!

I agree 1000%.  Stop being pansies and wear the freaking visors.  We won&#039;t think any less of you if you do.  In fact, we might think you are smarter because you&#039;ve chosen to protect your mug instead of letting it get broken.]]></description>
