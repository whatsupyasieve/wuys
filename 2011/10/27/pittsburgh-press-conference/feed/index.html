		<description><![CDATA[I went to the Draft in &#039;94 in Hartford.  All of the parts of that sentence are embarrassing.  How we talked my mom into taking three 14 year olds to Hartford for 3 days... the woman is a saint.  And it was SO BORING after the first 10 picks or so.  But we did run into (literally turned a corner and BOOM, Notting Hill-style) Eric Lindros.

I&#039;d post photos but it&#039;s just too horrible.  The arena was attached to mall that was attached to our hotel though, so it was pretty must &#039;tween chaos for everyone.]]></description>
