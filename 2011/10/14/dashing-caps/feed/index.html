		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t like Nicky&#039;s hair either! When they slick it like that it totally takes away from the beautiful blonde swedishness of his hair!
If Brooks were in this, they wouldn&#039;t need the four other guys. Hahaha]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hmmmm....why hello there Mr. Hendricks. Who knew you were so good looking.  Also, Matty has taken to heart Coach BB&#039;s catch phrase &quot;grab your sack&quot; and he is spreading the way of life to the masses.(see hand placement)
Nicky look like a 12 year old. And he makes me want to yodel. Is that weird?
Neuvy looks like a Bond villain. In a good way.
And Mike Knuble....they must have offered him cookies or something. He is just sitting there like the little kid in every family portrait like &quot;whatevs, take my pic. Now where&#039;s my ice cream sundae?&quot;
P.S. Little John Carlson is not so little. When he is not wielding a tire iron for the mafia, he should be a bodyguard....MY bodyguard.
All in all, this photo shoot reeks of excellence. And I don&#039;t even like the Caps. But how can I be angry about last night&#039;s loss when they look so darling in tweed. Not funny hockey gods, not funny.]]></description>
