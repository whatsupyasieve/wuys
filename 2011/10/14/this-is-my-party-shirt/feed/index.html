		<description><![CDATA[Lindsay,

I&#039;m ready to rally the troops down here in the south for Jonathan Toews world domination...that shirt should be illegal!

I can&#039;t wait until the 28th when the Hawks come to town to play the Canes...I will be wearing my Toews jersey and rooting on the Hawks! I hope Intern Jeff Skinner doesn&#039;t get too jealous that I am not wearing his jersey that night.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I got my tickets to the gun show immediately after seeing this video. And then sent Jess screengrabs since she can&#039;t watch vids at work. (I also got her email address wrong and someone out there in the universe is now enjoying Tazer&#039;s crazy biceps. You&#039;re welcome!)

Pants, we love you. And because we love WUYS, get thyselves over to the Hawks site to see their new &quot;One Goal&quot; vids - one of Captain Derp and another of shirtless Duncan Keith:
