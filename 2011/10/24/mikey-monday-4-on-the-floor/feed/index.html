		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Let me tell you something, Nicklas Backstrom is your dream boyfriend. Goal? Here you go. Ice cream? Let me get that for you. Honey, I just finished hand-washing your car and there’s all this water left, should I just pour it on myself? Shirt on or off?&quot;

Goddamn it, Pants. Stop being so freaking hilarious. I can barely contain my giggles.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I liked the facial hair more once I saw that he&#039;s got the goatee thing going on...slightly better than creepystache.  The only one I look forward to seeing with a stache LESS than Greenie is Alzner...no bueno.

Does it go against the rules to donate money to the players to shave during Movember?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am a proponent of all types of facial hair...with the exception of the soul patch.

I cannot abide by the soul patch.

Call me in 2 weeks when Mike&#039;s Conquistador facial hair has a chance to grow in a little.

Then we&#039;ll talk.]]></description>
