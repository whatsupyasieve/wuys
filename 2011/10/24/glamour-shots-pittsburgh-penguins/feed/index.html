		<description><![CDATA[So I guess it&#039;s time to retire the &quot;seriously pissed&quot; moniker.  I haven&#039;t been super pissed in a while, especially not while visiting WUYS!

I have mixed feelings about whether or not I would actually like to own this calender.  I would get to November and just stop.  It would be November, 2011 for the rest of my life.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ask and you shall recieve.....

Caps glamour shots from 2009 (a selected section of the entire photo shoot): http://www.flickr.com/photos/saskysaves/sets/72157617370964451/with/3485804448/

2009 was a great year for (lady) Caps fans--these were the photos used in their intros/goal announcements. I believe the rest of them can be seen, abiet piecemealed, at Scarlet Caps. Case in point: brooks laich shirtless http://scarlet.capitals.nhl.com/wp-content/gallery/brooks-laich/laich_9602_497a2e47444cb.jpg]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The dark eyes. The come hither stare.
Boy is FIONE!

Men are idiots.  They think Paris Hilton is attractive.  Really?  Come on, guys.

I don&#039;t know, but I think that we need to find away to get free copies of said calendar and give them away as WUYS prizes!

How do we maximize our free swag obtaining potential?]]></description>
