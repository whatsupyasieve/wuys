		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Pants. I really enjoyed this. Air Jordan because he&#039;s sponsored by Nike now. He is adorable and I will find some time to post soon - hopefully. I had no idea how busy i&#039;d be. Shocking when they compare it to drinking from a firehose! yeah ... and this is supposed to last three months until I&#039;m &#039;acclimated&#039; .... :0]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Three things I learned:
1. Ovi does not discriminate
2. He does in fact prefer shirts to pants (interesting...)
3. He&#039;s become really obsessed with Air Jordan brand lately.

I think it&#039;s from GQ, but I could be wrong. There is a video out there of a &quot;behind the scenes&quot; of this photo shoot.]]></description>
