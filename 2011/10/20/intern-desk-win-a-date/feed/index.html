		<description><![CDATA[I love living in Raleigh and having season tix to the Canes! He makes me want to buy the Jeff Skinner 5 game plan several times over...can I get a bobblehead for each ticket I have?

If anyone wants to come down to Raleigh for a visit, let me know. I can get seats at the season ticket holder price for any of the games.

I have to go now and enter the win a date with Jeff Skinner and figure out how I am going to break the news to my future husband, Jonathan Toews if I wind up winning...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I already told Chuck and Pants, but I&#039;m willing to transfer for you, Jeff. Just putting that out there...
Or maybe you can just pull a few strings with that smile of your&#039;s and bring the Whaler&#039;s back to CT. That works too. Water actually freezes on it&#039;s own up here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While I love this manchild an almost illegal amount, the take-home message from this post is that I could get tickets to FIVE Carolina games for less than the price of ONE Vancouver game.

FIVE.

And I am going to FIVE games this year. Which mean, if I lived in Raleigh, I could go to TWENTY-FIVE games.

TWENTY-FIVE.

God, that&#039;s depressing.

And I hate the Canucks too... which makes it sting all the more.]]></description>
