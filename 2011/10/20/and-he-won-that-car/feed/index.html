		<description><![CDATA[In the same boat as thego2girl...the Leaf lovin&#039; looks good on your blog and we got lots to love! More please! So Boston kicked our asses... I&#039;m blaming the fact that it was because Gus Gus and not Jesus Reimer was in net...and because instead of armstrong there was Kadri. DO NOT LIKE. You should all come visit during the parade, thank god it happens in the summer because no one will be doing work. No one, for months. We Torontonians know how to party!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do I suspect a little Toronto love? Read you guys religiously though first time commenting. I&#039;m a Leafs fan so felt I needed to comment. Kessel also has a 15 game point streak dating to back to last season, with better stats than anyone picked before him  at the dreaded all-star draft -.- Hope he kills &#039;em in Bean-town tonight ;)]]></description>
