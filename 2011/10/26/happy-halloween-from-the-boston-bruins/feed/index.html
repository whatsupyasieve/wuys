		<description><![CDATA[Yeeeah...Chara vs. Neal...not so much.  Both excellent hockey players but one decidedly more attractive than the other.

You gotta like the Bruins!  STANLEY CUP CHAMPS!  They might not be as GQ as the Hawks or Pens, but they have their own special charm.

And how can you NOT love Tim Thomas?!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chuck, was this your retaliation for us killing Pants with Nealmobile pictures?  Cause I&#039;m pretty sure Bunny Chara is the exact opposite of James Neal.

BRB, going to go check my closets and under my bed for terrifying, giant pink rabbits

Oh, and stop trying to make me like the Bruins!  They&#039;re actually sort of endearing.]]></description>
