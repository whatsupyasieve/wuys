&quot;I would put a love note in his locker but get the locker wrong and put it in his friend&#039;s locker instead and then at lunch when the entire gang came back from second period they would find it and laugh at it. True story.&quot;]]></description>

(Do you like my verbing of two nouns in that sentence?) This Mike Green: Professional Hockey Player would have been in Victoria with me during junior high times. Victoria is not big. I probably know someone who knows him.]]></description>
