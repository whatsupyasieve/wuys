		<description><![CDATA[Due to the size of Tazer&#039;s ass, it is only possible to view the video in widescreen. I am perfectly okay with that. Also check out how buff my birthday twin is! So proud of you PKane!!! PS I finally figured out you can comment even w/out a wordpress account, and have come out of read-only mode, so I&#039;d like to say I love your blog ladies!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am completely and utterly speechless...possibly because of the drool coming out of my mouth as I stare at JT&#039;s...well EVERYTHING! I am so happy that I can actually get WUYS at work and it is not firewalled so that I can escape into reality.

I will try and keep Intern Jeff Skinner in line tonight as the Canes open up against the Lightning, but I may be distracted by the images that have now been firmly imprinted in my mind...sigh]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can only assume there are no comments because EVERYONE HAS DIED.

Clearly my Captain sensed my thought-infidelity with the BEAST of a man that is Jordan Staal and 80% of the Pittsburgh Penguins last night so he rallied the troops to win back my imagilove. Don&#039;t worry my darling, it worked. I will never dream-stray again. I promise.]]></description>
