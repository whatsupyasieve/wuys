		<description><![CDATA[Oh dear... and this may just be wishful thinking, but here goes:

Eastern Conference Finals: Penguins vs. Lightning
Eastern Conference Champs: Penguins
Western Conference Finals: Blackhawks vs. Predators
Western Conference Champs: Blackhawks
Stanley Cup Champs: Penguins

EA sports agrees with me, at least on the finals. But I guess we&#039;ll just have to wait and see.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hahahahahaha.  This might be worth it. Can I get some squats?!  I love the Hawks, but I don&#039;t think this is their year.  But everyone I picked last year didn&#039;t make it, so perhaps it&#039;s just reverse psychology.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OK, here comes the newbie. :D

Let me say this first: this will be the first full NHL season I will be able to watch via Center Ice *woohoo*, so that&#039;s already my excuse if my predictions are totally wrong. :D

Eastern Conference Finals: Buffalo vs. Boston/Washington (can&#039;t really decide on one)

Eastern Conference Champs: Buffalo

Western Conference Finals: Vancouver vs. Chicago (wouldn&#039;t that be awesome?)

Western Conference Champs: Chicago

Stanley Cup Champs: Buffalo

The Sabres seem to have a pretty good team. Ennis and Myers impressed me pretty much when they played against Mannheim, Ehrhoff is definately a good addition and then they have Miller in the net. I will keep my fingers crossed for them. ;)
Like Chuck already pointed out the Bruins only lost 2 Players, so how far they will get will in my opinion mostly depend on if they have this &quot;Stanley Cup Hangover&quot; and of course whether or not they stay healthy. When it comes to Washington it will be interesting if the signing of Vokoun pays out (they already have a good team after all).

Although Vancouver is my favorite team, I don&#039;t think they will get as far as they got last season. Sure they have the Sedins, Kes, Burrows, Bieksa, ... but somehow I have the feeling they won&#039;t make it to the finals (but I wouldn&#039;t mind if I were completely wrong ;)).
And then there are the Blackhawks. Just looking at the roster made me think &quot;OK, this could work&quot;. I really like their playing style and enjoyed all the games I watched so far from the Hawks. So I would be happy if either one of the two would win the Western Conference.]]></description>
