		<description><![CDATA[I too, am excited. - Rob Ray might not of been the best scprpaer in the world, but he was pretty classy he lands a wicked shot on that guy and that was it   didn&#039;t try and land any more. - What was the story at the end of last year, where Ray&#039;s eyes just about popped out of his head? I can&#039;t remember what it was that he saw (or if we ever found out).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t really have much of an opinion on Avery. All I know is that he&#039;s a major troll and I&#039;m really not surprised.
The first picture reminds me of when little seven year old boys ask &quot;Do you like seafood?&quot; while chewing and then open their mouth wide.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not shedding a single tear over this! In fact I think a celebration is in order! The NHL will (hopefully) have one less douchebag to worry about! Although with all of the suspensions being dished out already he probably wouldn&#039;t have played much this season anyway.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Glad that a-hole is getting booted off yet another team!  Did he learn nothing in mini-mites?  Kids - this is what happens when you don&#039;t listen to your parents and your coaches!  You become the most hated player in the NHL and beyond.

But happy news that he&#039;s getting what he deserves!]]></description>
