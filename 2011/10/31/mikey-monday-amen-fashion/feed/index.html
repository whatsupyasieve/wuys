		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sure Mikey gets A LOT of *ahem* attention from the ladies. As long as he wraps it before he taps it :).

He&#039;s look mighty spiffy in that suit. Love the perfect hair.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awwww, Jess! Don&#039;t do that to yourself! The result was what it was because of what the players did/did not do on the ice. ;) Sounds so simplistic, but wouldn&#039;t want you to blame yourselves! :)

And how jealous am I that you saw him in THIS outfit?? 0.o]]></description>
