		<description><![CDATA[What really grinds my gears about this is that they refrence one hit from last year as a basis of establishing frequency. I know this whole boarding issue is a slippery slope but Tanger is no Matt Cooke, no Raffi Torres, no what&#039;s his face from the islanders that throws his weight at anything that moves. I bet if you looked at every player&#039;s record they probably have one or two bad hits in there, because unfortunately sometimes they can&#039;t be helped. I just feel like the way this has all come down makes Kris look like a habitual offender and he&#039;s not.]]></description>
