		<description><![CDATA[You guys know how much I love Letang... but I think he gets suspended.  The NHL will make an example of him.  It will send a strong message to everyone - &quot;Everyone, even star players who are very beautiful, have to follow the rules.  We don&#039;t even care if all of your other stars are out with injuries.  We&#039;ll still suspend you if you are too good at hockey.&quot;  Sorry, that started out as a legitimate point and I got all snarky because I&#039;m pissed.]]></description>
