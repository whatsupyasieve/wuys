		<description><![CDATA[Yes!!!!!!!!!!!! But only if you have that great photo of Seguin with a heart rate monitor on.

Which is worse - that I think that photo is sexy, or that the &quot;half your age plus 7&quot; ratio means I&#039;m two years above the limit for thinking Seguin is attractive?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am so knitting a scarf to go with that jacket. Really. And if they win, I may even bake them a winner&#039;s cake. With the logo on.

I&#039;ll consider their getting through to the finals my birthday present from them. :D]]></description>
