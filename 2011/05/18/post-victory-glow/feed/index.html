		<description><![CDATA[Nostradamays,

My dear friend, do not fear.  There will be no popping of Cristal until the Bruins win the Stanley Cup. You can be sure of that.

Yes, they gave up a few more goals than we&#039;d like but it is hard to shut down a team with offensive threats like Stamkos, St. Louis, and VL4.  Every time they touch the puck, I get that feeling in my chest.  Feeling of dread and the thought that it is not going to end well.

I love Martin St. Louis.  I&#039;d love him even more if he were on my team.

Why are your parents being so hateful?  Did you get them a crappy Christmas present or something?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Let&#039;s not pop the champagne just yet.  Am I glad the Bruins won?  Absolutely.  Am I glad that my predictions about Seguin having a huge impact on this series for the Bs are turning out to be true?  You bet your Nostradamus ass I am.  Am I ready to celebrate and anoint this kid as the second coming of Bobby Orr?  No.

The Bruins did give up TEN goals over the last two games.  That&#039;s about TEN too many for me.  Also, it still feels like Tampa&#039;s forwards (especially that little bitch St. Louis) fly right past the defense whenever they want.  This needs to be fixed.

Like I said.  Glad they won, but one thing at a time.

Laura, if you want to go to Tampa, you can stay with my parents down there.  They are NY transplants who are suddenly &quot;Bolts&quot; fans just to make me angry.  It&#039;s nauseating.]]></description>
