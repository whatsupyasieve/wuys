		<description><![CDATA[Or the Hiperd?

No?

Right, it doesn&#039;t have quite the same feel to it.

While Pants loathes this whole Mikey tattoo fiasco, I&#039;m sort a digging it.  I like the juxtaposition (10pt word) of the nerdiness of the glasses and the BAMF-ness of the full sleeve.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No comment on the tattoo, yet. I haven&#039;t quite figured out my thoughts.

Those photos weren&#039;t from his apartment...perhaps the hotel room of the dude that flew out to do the ink? Mikey&#039;s pad is MUCH nicer (in was profiled in a NoVA designer magazine last year).

And those glasses, I don&#039;t even notice anything else when he&#039;s rockin&#039; those glasses. *WEAK KNEES*]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t decide how I feel about tattoos.  I think I kind of like them, as long as they aren&#039;t stupid.  And that&#039;s the problem.  Most of them are sooooo stupid.  So I can&#039;t decide about Mike&#039;s tattoo here because I&#039;d need to see the whole thing and hear his explanation about what the hell it&#039;s supposed to mean.  I kind of respect when guys get the whole sleeve done.  Like if you&#039;re going to get a tattoo, you might as well get a huge one that says &quot;I am totally serious about tattoos.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It gets worse!!!! Mike JUST Tweeted the final product. Uuuuggghh. I like tattoos but the glasses and half sleeve together are too much. One person genre at a time, Mike, please! Either nerd OR hipster. Not at the same time.

The only good news is Mike is coming home to Calgary TODAY! Meaning Operation Stalking Fidget 2011 begins STAT!]]></description>

He&#039;s prolly at home in Calgary, so you know what you should do, right?
