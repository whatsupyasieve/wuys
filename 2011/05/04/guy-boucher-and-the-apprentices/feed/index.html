		<description><![CDATA[Pants, don&#039;t beat yourself up.  It wasn&#039;t your fault that Stamkos and his beard mesmerized you and got you off your game.

Dwayne Roloson = ageless wonder?  I say drug test him!  GHB??]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s no one fault but the boys! They couldn&#039;t make it past the swamp of tears! They didn&#039;t want it bad enough and Guy Boucher is a mad hatter! Artax! I just feel bad for Jason Arnott. He waived his no move clause and now he&#039;s in no-man&#039;s land. I hope they keep him. Any one for a turkish chicken dance in a Speedo?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so confused. How did this happen? HOW DID A SWEEP HAPPEN?! The Bolts have father time in the cage and still they pull it out! I&#039;m so sad to see Mikey go. He was my adopt-a-player! :(

That&#039;s not to say that Stamkos and little baby st.louis aren&#039;t great, because they are. But I can&#039;t help but be terrified of Guy Boucher. Let&#039;s look at the facts here...1) the facial scar looks like he got into a knife fight. &quot;If I look like this, you should see the other guys!&quot; 2) his voice sounds like a batman villain. Seriously, the sound of it alone could strike fear in the hearts of men everywhere. 3)Two words... shifty eyes. The man is up to something.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You guys... I&#039;m so sorry.  This is all my fault.  You said we should adopt someone to help us get over the Pens loss, and I adopted St. Louis.  I didn&#039;t know it would go down like this.

But there is some good news today as well!  Boston destroyed the Flyers, and what is this?  The Sharks lead the Redwings 3-0 in the series?  Wheeee!!!]]></description>
