		<description><![CDATA[OMG. This is the best post I&#039;ve ever seen. Seriously, linking to &quot;Fancy&quot;? I remember watching that video on CMT when it came out in 1991, when I was 8 years old. I can&#039;t stop laughing.

I&#039;m with you - I love the Penguins and the Hawks, but damn 24/7 has made me love the Caps - and now they&#039;re totally blowing it. I&#039;m scared of what BB will do to the boys when they lose. Because at this point, there&#039;s no hope. After picking the Hawks, Pens, Ducks, Red Wings and  Canadiens to win, I have no faith in my hockey choices. Have a great summer golfing, boys.]]></description>
