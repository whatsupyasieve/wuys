		<description><![CDATA[Sadly I can&#039;t make it, but you did get the cake I baked at the weekend, right? I did Fedex it over. The one with the Carolina logo painted on. Cake Boss Buddy and Duff Goldman both think I should quit here and go work for them.

Bless, Intern Jeff keeps that tie still knotted but loosened. It&#039;s in the top drawer of his desk. But I got him a new tie. Silk. Hope ya like it! Enjoy the party and no spiking the punch! Pants, I&#039;m looking at you...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is just precious. Party is at 4 in the conference room? Could you maybe, just maybe, extend an invite this way? Skinner is adorable and I know the day is supposed to be all about him, but if Staal and Ward RSVPed, I might be stalking around outside, anyway.

Plus, I feel like I need to try one of these Mexi-Colas.]]></description>
