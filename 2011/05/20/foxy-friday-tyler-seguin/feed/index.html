		<description><![CDATA[Oh Man. So NOT legal. I can&#039;t swing that &quot;half-your-age-plus-how-many-years-was-it-again?&quot; Nope. Not at all.  He is almost HALF my age.

JESUS.

And as for that speed he displays: puts Croz to shame sometimes. I was speechless when I saw it.  And I saw his first goal with the team in Belfast!

Bless, Baby Ty-Ty all growed up.

I think you should make &quot;I&#039;m a Seguinista&quot; t-shirts, Chuck.

Just sayin&#039;.]]></description>
