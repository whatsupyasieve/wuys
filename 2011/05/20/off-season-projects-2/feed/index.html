He will forever be the winner of the panty soup cook-off.

		<description><![CDATA[OMFG - most likely to make me collapse into a pile of mush on the floor?! On the Sauce Hockey website, under &quot;Side Notes&quot; (see Living the Dream), it reads:

&quot;Has a culinary show on the Food Network where he shares his recipe for &quot;Panty Soup&quot;, won a Nobel Peace Prize for inventing &quot;Twooping&quot; - using Twitter while pooping &#038; his religious belief is &quot;Savagery&quot;&quot;.

OMG!

And if you haven&#039;t seen this yet, it&#039;s worth it for shirtless... well I&#039;ll leave you to drool...

		<description><![CDATA[He totally reminds me of a jerk I knew in high school but now... it&#039;s like that jerk moved away and went to college and came back with a whole new outlook on life and a sensitive side... while wearing a tux and getting sweaty and bloody.
