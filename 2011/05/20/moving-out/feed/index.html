		<description><![CDATA[It took a while to get here, but reading THN, there&#039;s all this havering and huffing about teams all being moved around the WHL etc etc, a bit like musical chairs, leaving some teams with no homes in their cities, because they&#039;ve moved a team there and all because an NHL team may (or may not) move to Winnipeg, which has got Edmonton all up in arms, not to mention the hockey players, who are all terrified of frostbite to their extremities in the ravages of a plains winter. As well they might be.

Not to mention last I heard the Yotes might be moving, so let&#039;s just say I&#039;m all confused now anyway, but that&#039;s not hard.  Show me hockey statistics and percentages and I sorta tune out.  I am easily confused.

That sounds way too much like I know what I&#039;m talking about or in fact a comment worthy of an email to the editors of THN/4th Period.

It&#039;s official; I have been hockeyed. Well and truly.  I bleed black and gold. Nae hope left.]]></description>
