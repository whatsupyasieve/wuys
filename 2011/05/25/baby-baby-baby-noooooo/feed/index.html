		<description><![CDATA[OMG - did you see Logan&#039;s Tweets from this afternoon? For realz:

&quot;Heartbreak.&quot;

&quot;Man, the season ends too quickly. Just comes to a stop out of nowhere. Feels weird not going to the rink today. Thanks for an amazing year.&quot;

&quot;Sharks fans. Truly blessed to play in a city where fans are so proud of their team. Thank you for the support through the highs and the lows.&quot;

&quot;It was quite a journey this year. We will come back stronger and hungrier next year. #stayloud fans, we can still hear you.&quot;

This sad shark is crying now. Poor Logan.]]></description>
