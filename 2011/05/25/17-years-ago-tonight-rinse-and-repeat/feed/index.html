		<description><![CDATA[Pretty sure you need an arena first, so until that happens, you&#039;re safe! And because of the dearth of cute, single guys on the Canucks, I am forced to look around. Fortunately the Olympics gave me a chance to check out the top of the pops.
Et Kris Letang, mais oui!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[And here I thought you lived in LA ... because of Drew - LOL! If you are in Montreal  - are you stocking Kris Letang? Because maybe I could hide in your suitecase? I will e-mail you and we will see if can hook up. :) That would be fun! No secret location - sucking in Seattle. Now since Vancouver is &#039;WINNING&#039; everyone is talking about getting us an NHL team. NOOOOOOOOOO! professional sports teams are BAD  for us. the sonics left us, the chicken hawks suck and the mariners have never won a series. don&#039;t curse a blessed, holy NHL team with leaving them here. that&#039;s what&#039;s Toronto&#039;s for! oops!;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yah, I am in Vancouver!  You&#039;re at some secret location in Washington, right? I was at the Olympics too, Canada vs. Switzerland men&#039;s, and lots of women&#039;s games. Best game atmosphere ever.

My problem, and it&#039;s a big one, I have a trip to Montreal scheduled during the finals, so it depends on how long the finals go. (I get to find out if the Canucks are Canada&#039;s team, but I&#039;m sure if we play Boston, everyone in Montreal will be cheering for us!) So we&#039;ll have to play it by ear, let me know your plans, my email&#039;s on my blog profile.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So are you telling me you live in Vancouver? Because Mr. Cherrie and I were there for the Olympics and scored mens icehockey tickets. Anyhow ... we are not thinking we will be lucky enough for tickets this time around but were planning on going up for the game anyway to just watch it in the streets - probably Robson. So if you do, would love to try and hook up! that would be a gas!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Go north young woman!  If it&#039;s anything like the Olympics, Vancity will be one awesome party, and you must be a part of it. Well, knowing the Canucks, it will be be one stressful nail-biting series, and then one awesome party. Apparently good tickets from resalers are only $4,000 (each) but we do have big screens set up downtown.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is nothing to confer. The TWINS for WORLD DOMINATION. As shown by those mad dance moves Danny was about to bust out on those skates. Plus, this is the closest I will ever get to a stanley cup play off so Mr. Cherrie and I are making a run for the border - BEWARE!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Confetti on the ice = worst idea eva!

On the bright side, while it was legit, the officials were still conferring on the goal, but dropping two tons of Mike Gillis&#039;s shredded documents for world domination pretty much prevented the game from ever resuming. Yes, you guys keep debating it, we&#039;ll just take our conference trophy and run! Without actually touching the trophy, of course.]]></description>
