		<description><![CDATA[Have I told the writers of WUYS that I love them lately? Because I do.

I wrote essentially the same post on my blog last night. I&#039;m having a hard time saying goodbye to that beard.

Nice touch with &quot;Webeard.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[By that logic are we now going to call the Professor Bearderon? And doesn&#039;t it sound a bit Star Wars-y?

Help me Obi-Wan Bearderon - you&#039;re my only hope...?

Speaking of which, he better not be and I hope he gets well soon!]]></description>
