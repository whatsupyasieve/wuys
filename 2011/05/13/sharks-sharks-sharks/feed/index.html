		<description><![CDATA[Ya&#039;ll are crazy and I can&#039;t be friends with you right now, if you&#039;re on the TB Train.

The Bear and I will stare you down in a creepy staring contest until you feel awkward.

Pants - have you told Intern Jeff that you are backing Couture for the Calder?  Might not want to advertise that or you might never see your Swingline again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Same soft spot here, which is doubly-weird considering my addiction to the Capitals.  I know they&#039;re bad.  I try to stop.  People who love me (Crosby) try to intervene.  I just can&#039;t help myself.  And now Tampa Bay... ugh.  Stamkos, damn you and your general irresistable-ness and beard.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Shi, we shall be hated together.  I&#039;d like to see Tampa-San Jose in the final.  But I wouldn&#039;t cry all over the place if Boston makes it.  Boston&#039;s fine.  But I&#039;ve developed this weird soft spot for Tampa, which is just insane because they eliminated the Pens. What is wrong with me???]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I cheered for the Pens (of course), when they lost I told my friend that I would be all about the lightning from then on out, but I was bitter and cheered for the Caps. Well now... now I have no choice, the lightning are my team. Little baby St.Louis, Lovely Lecavalier, and Sean &quot;Where the hell did have I been all season?&quot; Bergenheim. Who knows, maybe my support is a curse and the bolts will fall but I have to say I think I like them best. I&#039;m sorry, I know that&#039;s blasphemous around here. Don&#039;t hate me.]]></description>
