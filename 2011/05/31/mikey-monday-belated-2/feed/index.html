		<description><![CDATA[I was going to post that Billion Acts of Green video, but you beat me too it! He seriously could not be more adorable if he tried. Or, actually, he probably could. I&#039;ve decided, that since Tazer has a for-reals girlfriend, which kind of puts a damper on our all-in-my-imagination relationship, that Mikey will be my new one and only one ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[O.M.G. I had to watch this video in stages to keep my giggles under control at work. Fidget is like an adorable 8-year-old when he says his name. Apparently he&#039;s forgotten there&#039;s a &quot;t&quot; in Washington - cute!

They definitely got the script wrong - it absolutely SHOULD be a billion acts of Mike Green. Hello, nurse!

Plus, good to know Mike can garden - I&#039;ll add gardening centres to my list of stalking locations for Operation MG52 this summer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s ME!!! I know - stalking Mike is my summer project. I figure that since he only got home like a week ago, he&#039;s probably holed up at his house on a &quot;lake.&quot; In Calgary we have several subdivisions (the entire city is suburbs, so they&#039;re subdivisions) with man-made lakes. Thumbs up, Calgary.

But Mike will probably be out and about with the Stampede broo-haha that starts next month! PLUS - Kate and William are coming to town July 6-8 so we&#039;ll see if Greener and his buddy Paul are royal fans!

I hear you Pants, on the summer boredom. Pierre Lebrun Tweeted about the Thrashers moving to Winnipeg and that he&#039;d spoken to Tazer about it. I actually re-tweeted it - it totally made my day. I&#039;ve also circled the following dates on the calendar: June 21 (2011-2012 schedule announced), June 22 (NHL awards), June 24-25 (entry draft), Jule 1 (free agency). That&#039;s all I got.

I&#039;ll keep you ladies posted of any Greener sightings here in Cowtown!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was at the NKOTBSB concert in Baltimore on Sunday and I was looking at all the tattoos as well! I had the luxury of Nick Carter and Joey walking right in front of me to get on and off the stage. It was a nice diversion for NOT having hockey right now!!! They all came out with Celtics jerseys and I thought it would have been nice to represent the Bruins.... (I felt SO old btw!)]]></description>
