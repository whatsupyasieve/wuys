		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m actually pretty sad about this. I don&#039;t have a hockey team where I live (boo!) but it wasn&#039;t so bad having Atlanta 4 hours north and Tampa 4 hours south to keep me going. Not to mention I spent half of my childhood in the ATL and it feels like a second home to me. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m a Pens fan but I liked the Thrashers being close by, and being able to (sort of) call a city with a team Home.]]></description>
