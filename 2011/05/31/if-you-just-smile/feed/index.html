		<description><![CDATA[Wow - I can&#039;t believe how much better his face looks!

The beard was overboard for me - sexy for a while and then just scary. And that injury. I&#039;m STILL simultaneously welling with pride at his ability to get back out there and play the game and a bit nauseated thinking of the injury.

He looks like he can&#039;t fully open his eyes - is that an injury thing? Regardless, we&#039;ll see you in a few weeks at the NHL awards, Stammer. Rest up and enjoy the next few weeks.]]></description>
