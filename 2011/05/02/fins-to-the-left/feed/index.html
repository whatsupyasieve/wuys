		<description><![CDATA[Why, why, why?? How can you hate Detroit? Is it their rivalry with the Hawks? That I can understand. Your hatred for the fountain of youth and how those old guys somehow keep succeeding?

And cheering for the Sharks? My only real issue is how Ryan(e) Clow(e) spells his name. Seriously, does Newfoundland(e) just like to tack on E&#039;s to names?

That said, I completely disagree with your assertion that Feel the Teal is a bad slogan - that&#039;s the best part of this post, and really, the only reason you could actually cheer for the Sharks.]]></description>
