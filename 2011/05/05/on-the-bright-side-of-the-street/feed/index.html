		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with Pants from earlier today. After the Hawks, Pens AND Caps lost, I feel as cursed as the Titanic. Now Detroit&#039;s on their way out as well. For realz - I might as well start cheering for Vancouver to ensure their demise. They&#039;re really the only team that I DON&#039;T want to win the cup. Anyone but them I&#039;d be happy with.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dude - they win and sod placement, I am flying over for that victory parade on Tremont Street!  OK so I won&#039;t cos I&#039;ll be like days away from finishing placement, but I&#039;ll expect you to go and take loads of pics and email them pronto!

We can dream! I mean, there is a strong possibility desperation is going to kick in at Game 4.  But there&#039;s an equal chance we might do a TB and how exciting would that be. (I&#039;ll be wearing my Bruins wear EVERYWHERE uniform be damned!)

I am spending a great deal of time at the moment explaining Ice Hockey and the Stanley Cup to people. Loads. I think they think I&#039;m nuts.  This is why I want to be proper Canadian instead of Fauxnadian. :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Last time I checked, Chara was from Slovakia. But that is close to Meepos, right?

No matter.  Last night&#039;s game was great. Bruins came out jumping and never looked back.

Tim Thomas = amazeballs]]></description>
