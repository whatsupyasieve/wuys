		<description><![CDATA[Big game for the Sharks yesterday and the 3 assists from Joe were huge. Joe Thornton has to continue to play the same way and help lead his team to the Stanley Cup. They can&#039;t do it without a solid performance throughout from. I don&#039;t think they need him to be super Joe of the regular season but definitely better than he has been. And I gotta be honest, I cheer against the Sharks just cuz it&#039;s kind of fun to see them flop every year but really it&#039;s good for Joe because he&#039;s a class act. They better not lose this one because I can&#039;t imagine how Joe&#039;s legacy will suffer even more.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You should do the world a favour and root for the Canucks. I would, except I hate them too much for it to be remotely realistic and it would just backfire on me.

Take one for the team, Pants!]]></description>
