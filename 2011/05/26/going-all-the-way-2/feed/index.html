		<description><![CDATA[Three thoughts from this game:

1. God, this series needs to end - hopefully with Boston winning. Not only do I think they&#039;re the only team that can beat the Canucks, it&#039;s time for Steven&#039;s beard to end. There was a point back at the beginning of the Washington series that it was hot and he gained entrance into my 2011-2012 Hockey Hottie Pool, but it needs to end. Not good.

2. I have to give another shout out at how awesome hockey is. Where else could you do a media interview, and have names like Stammer, Vinnie, Bergie, Tazer, Kaner, Sharpie, Croz, Flower, Soupy and Seabs mentioned? Wicked.

3. Squishy and Vinnie are like a fine wine - they just keep getting better with age. Both in looks and talent. I remember the 2004 cup run (when Calgary actually won Game 6 but I&#039;m not bitter) and they were not appealing. At all. Now - yowza. Keep doin&#039; what you&#039;re doin&#039; boys. Unless of course, that means beating Boston. Less of that.]]></description>
