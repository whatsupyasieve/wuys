		<description><![CDATA[Yeah - I do. And I&#039;m from the Island orignally as well.

I made the mistake of watching VanChi Game 7 in a bar here. (Although it would have been just as obnoxious at home as my upstairs neighbour is a fanatic). I wept so many hockey failure tears. I wish that if the Hawks had to lose that game, they would have lost it by a lot. Toews&#039;s tying goal at the end of the 3rd LITERALLY gave me a heart attack. Like, I was having actual tingling numbness in my left arm.

Hopefully obnoxious Canucks fans didn&#039;t sour you entirely on my lovely province. When we&#039;re not having 8 months of winter, it really is quite beautiful ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jess - do you live in Vancouver? My sympathies, sister. I just got back from a week on Vancouver Island and Salt Spring Island and it ALMOST killed me. My husband made me watch a San Jose/Canucks game IN A BAR WITH CANUCKS FANS. We had to leave after the second period, it was so awful. And the flags, jerseys, and WTF is with the Canucks Tim Hortons donuts?? Really?? Is that necessary??

I still can&#039;t move on from Chicago losing in overtime. If only - then they&#039;d have shut down the Canucks again. A girl can dream.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sweet! Schedule doesn&#039;t conflict with either of my NKOTBSB concerts either!

Ugh - I can&#039;t believe Vancouver is in the final. This city is going to be insufferable for two weeks. Canucks fans are the worst. People told me that I deserved to die because I was cheering for the Hawks in round 1. Stay classy Vancouver.
They cannot win the Cup. The awards (which I am SO going to!!!!! OMG) are already going to be all Creepy Ginger Twins and slimy overrated Italian-Canadian goalies.

Rant over.

PS - congrats on your wedding Pants! Best of Luck!!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We&#039;ll be there too, Lisa!  And on June 3 at Verizon.  Because we&#039;re nuts.  Perhaps we should plan a pre-NKOTBSB happy hour stop near 1st Mariner Arena?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[At least we have Bob Cole calling the game and not Jim Hughson; I&#039;d turn the TV off after the first &quot;GREEAAAT SAAAAVE LUONGO!!!&quot; I&#039;ve never heard a bigger homer on CBC.


I&#039;m very jealous that Pants is going to not one, but TWO NKOTBSB concerts. I won&#039;t even be able to make it to the one in Edmonton. :(]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It physically pains me to see the Vancouver logo. I get it, I get it - I should just move on and accept the fact that Vancouver will probably win the Cup. I just keep imagining Henrik Sedin kissing the cup and throwing up a little bit.

Anyways - I digress. LOVE the fact that NBC is carrying some of the games - it&#039;ll give me some much needed Pierre McGuire-isms that have been sorely lacking in this playoffs. Plus one downside to being Canadian (yes, there are a few Pants/Chuck) is CBC&#039;s love affair with the Canucks. They all proudly wear their Burrows and Kesler jerseys during the game - so much for &quot;objectivity.&quot;

What did you and Mr. Pants decide on for your honeymoon? Are you hitting up the NHL awards in Vegas??]]></description>
