		<description><![CDATA[I am blessed (seriously, with what I&#039;m about to tell you, it is true) to work for a cable provider in Canada, which means I get 50% off NHL Centre Ice. My hubby asked if it was really necessary to get it - at which point I gave him a rude look and laughed bitterly. Up to 40 games per week? Ummm....yes, PLEASE!

Just 49 more days to go. We can do this, ladies!!]]></description>
