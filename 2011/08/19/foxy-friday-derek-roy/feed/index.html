		<description><![CDATA[Ha! I can&#039;t believe this discussion, since right now a friend was just deciding whether to go on a blind date because she thought the guy was too short...and he is 5&#039;9&quot; and she&#039;s 5&#039;4&quot;.  I said definitely not too short, since I&#039;ve dated guys as short as 5&#039;2&quot; (which was too short, btw).  Bodies look proportionally better on shorter guys, if that makes sense.

So I say: Not too short! 5&#039;9&quot; is perfect!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If all of Buffalo looks like this I might actually start watching Sabres games....

Honestly, I was expecting Foxy to be Taylor Pyatt&#039;s eyes (not Taylor Pyatt, just his eyes) for his birthday, but Mr. Roy you are fine!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[He *is* cute... even though I&#039;d need -1&quot; heels to date him :P

May I suggest a future Foxy Friday?

Evander Kane. He is beautiful, he is a Harry Potter fan and he tweets shirtless pictures of himself. &#039;Nuff said.]]></description>

I need to throw out my heels and update my collection of cute flats if I&#039;m going to date you, but it&#039;s a sacrifice I&#039;m willing to make.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1.  His brother&#039;s name is Pepper.  That is cartoon-style adorable, like Patty Mayonnaise.  (Dates self, you&#039;re probably not old enough to remember Doug.)
2. Derek was so amazed by feminine hygiene products in the ladies&#039; room that he Tweeted a picture of them.  This guy is gold!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great choice!! Seems like since D Roy has hit the Twitter scene he has just blown up! Some pretty funny posts! P.S. Pretty sure the dude in the pic with the Sox hat is his brother Pepper...http://yfrog.com/user/Roy9ner/photos

Also have to agree with previous comment, head on he&#039;s lookin fiiiiine, but the side view...not so much. It could also be because he&#039;s rocking the &quot;Zach Morris - The College Years&quot; hair cut in that second pic.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not very tall, but I definitely do not find 5&#039;9&quot; to be short. Well, maybe the tall side of short.  ;)

Derek is cute - head on. His profile not so much. He has a mouth and jaw like Ron Perlman.]]></description>
