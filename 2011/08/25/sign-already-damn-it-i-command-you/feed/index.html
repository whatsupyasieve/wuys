		<description><![CDATA[How are things in Dispose these days? I&#039;m in Montreal, it&#039;s hot and I haven&#039;t even seen Kris Letang yet.

But, speaking of tall, dark and hunky d-men...I think DD should hold out for the money he wants, I&#039;m pretty sure that the numbers aren&#039;t far apart, but Dean Lombardi is all young-man-you&#039;re-not-getting-your-allowance-until-you&#039;ve-done-your-chores.  Franchise defensemen only come around once in a lifetime, why piss them off and risk losing them? I know I&#039;m biased, but I hate when GM&#039;s use the media to put the screws on the players, and there have been lots of negative rumours this summer.

On to more important stuff, DD looks great and I&#039;m sure he&#039;s going to sign before the regular season and have an amazing year.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[He is holding out for more donuts and he&#039;s simply not going to get them from LA! I heart him but he&#039;s no Shea Weber. sorry. Maybe in a few years. He needs some more experience and someone needs to bring him down to planet earth and have a little chat about REALITY!

I want to come but $$$ and something else. We can chat off line. :)]]></description>
