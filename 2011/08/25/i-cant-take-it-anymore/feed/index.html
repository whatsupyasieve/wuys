		<description><![CDATA[Do you see this? I am so severely traumatized by the Crosby news I&#039;m getting his endorsements wrong. Take away my fangirl title. I don&#039;t deserve it anymore.

Double embarrassement for the fact that I&#039;m Canadian. Or at least my passport says I am.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Isn&#039;t The Croz from a SportChek commercial? Jeeeez Lindsay.

I&#039;m not much of a Pens fan, or a Crosby fan, but I think it would be horrible if he had to retire so young. I sincerely hope he plays, soon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Totes agree with the Toronto Star column. Shut it, beotch. Can you imagine how terrible that would be for Sid if he didn&#039;t get to play the game he loved?

More than anything, just concerned for the Croz (thank you, Canadian Tire commercial!) and his family. Must be so stressful to have the barrage of reporters breathing down your neck, &quot;demanding&quot; a statement as Jeff Marek said. Crosby doesn&#039;t owe anyone anything and rumours don&#039;t help.

Poeople just need to back off and let Sid get better. I&#039;m relieved that the specialists have told Crosby they&#039;re not concerned long-term, it&#039;s still just a short-term issue. When he&#039;s ready he&#039;ll come back. And if not I&#039;ll cry rivers of tears.

Let me know when the next Crosby prayer circle is in session - I&#039;m totally there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Love the animations! Honestly, I hope he gets better - despite my unconditional loyalty to Boston and Patrice Bergeron, (he needs to pop out of my cake. a little help with that?).

However, concussions are extremely serious so yes, we need a prayer circle.  :)]]></description>
