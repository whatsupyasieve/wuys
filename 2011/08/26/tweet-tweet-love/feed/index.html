		<description><![CDATA[The guy is full of gems - some other beauties:

&quot;I knew it was gonna be a long flight when I sat down and girl next to me said &#039;oh cool headphones! I have same ones but mine are red, Nuts!&#039;&quot;

&quot;Cool, but they&#039;re completely out of their minds. RT @Paneech Team 1260 in Edmonton say if you stay healthy you can get 65 points next year.&quot;

&quot;Vicious traffic is so much better when you have a hot girl in the car next to you. #sunglassesnowon&quot;

&quot;Great view of Boston Harbor from our table at new Legal Seafood in South Boston. Woman in yellow dress top left helps.&quot;

Awesome!]]></description>
