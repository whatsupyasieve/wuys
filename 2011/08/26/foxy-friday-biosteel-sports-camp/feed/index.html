Does that remind anyone else of that scene in Zoolander when Derek and Hansel are trying to get the files &quot;out of the computer&quot;? Just me?  Oookay...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh lordy...call me a happy, happy girl. (Of course the EMT/nurse in me was all &quot;he needs mouth-to-mouth&quot; when Tyler lays out on the floor). I guess the good thing is he&#039;s only 3 yrs younger than me.

Thank you for making a dull day so much brighter (and sexier!) :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I believe it was me who was admiring young young Seguin in his suit. But the t-shirt? Oh yes, the t-shirt is much better. That manchild, lord help me... As Chuck said, bad bad but good things.

There is a Day 5 video as well, the link for which currently evades me, wherein Seguin is throwing a medicine ball. It&#039;s official. It needs to be it&#039;s own category.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seguin makes me think bad, bad, yet good things.

Watching those video makes me realize a few things:

Stamkos is really really really fast.
Intern Jeff&#039;s smile just makes you all warm and fuzzy.
Hockey players doing yoga = hot.
Doing yoga in their unders = lava.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[S*$@#*(&#038;@$S)(#$_)%^+!&#038;*^

OK, that&#039;s done. Seriously, I&#039;m gonna die looking at this photos and video. But really, isn&#039;t this the best way to go?

The half your age plus 7 rule (aka, the only math you ever need to know) is getting broken because of Segs in that shirt. ROWR!

And Stammer with his quad muscles? And Biz doing yoga?

Thanks ladies. It was nice knowing you.]]></description>
