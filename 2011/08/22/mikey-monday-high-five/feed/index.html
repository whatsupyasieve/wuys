		<description><![CDATA[TEN BUCKS?!!?

Sometimes I hate living in a hockey market... Even though the Oilers are crap, you can&#039;t get into Rexall for less than 50 bucks... to stand...

I think even preseason it&#039;s 50 bucks for nosebleeds. Canada sucks sometimes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do you know what I read in the first place? -&#062; &quot;ONLY 5 DAYS until our first hockey game of the season!!&quot; I was just about to bounce up and down that time flew by and hockey is around the corner when I noticed the September Date :/ I&#039;m really that excited about hockey starting again that I just skip August everytime in my head. ^^

But what I&#039;m really looking forward is (besides the start of the german league on 18th Sept.) 4th October, when the Sabres play against Mannheim and I&#039;ll be seeing for the first time in my life a NHL Team live. *woohoo*
(Sorry for the Offtopic, but my friends are unfortunately not at all into hockey and don&#039;t get why I&#039;m super excited)

And thank you very much for that wonderful blog it really helps me to get through the off- season. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hear you on the desperation. Today I dropped $720 for two tickets to two Hawks games. I&#039;m &quot;surprising&quot; my hubby and taking him to Chicago for his birthday in November, and didn&#039;t bat an eye at tickets that were $190 each. What? Who have I become?

I&#039;ve even looked up our seats at the United Center and emailed photos to my family of where we&#039;re sitting. Each passing day that leads to the pre-season has my hockey desperation increasing exponentially.]]></description>
