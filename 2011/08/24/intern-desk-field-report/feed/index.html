		<description><![CDATA[When Biosteele tweeted this yesterday, I started watching it on the bus thinking, as it is likely edited by men for men, it would not be pornographic. But then the first 20 seconds were Tyler Seguin wearing the SH*T out of a suit and I simultaneously fainted, squealed and had a bout of fangirl Tourettes (&quot;fitfitfitfitsofitsososofithhhnnnggghhhh&quot;), and then proceeded to flag this video &quot;for private times only&quot;.

Also - Intern Jeff Skinner&#039;s boy-face-man-body causes me to be deeply conflicted. Do I want to babysit him or do I want to cougar-pounce all over that? Am I the only one? I am? Okay, forget I said anything. I&#039;ll just be over here, weeping fangirl tears.]]></description>
