		<description><![CDATA[You will likely have to spend aonurd 100 bucks depending on the time of the year (playoffs are the most expensive if you team makes it, off-season is where you can get it for cheaper), the quality (legit from Reebok or not? you get what you pay for), where you are (city of the home team or not? if you live in the same city, it will cost more to get it) and the team (some cities charge more). The price will be the same online and in store or a small difference unless you get it from a non-official seller based in asia or something. It won&#039;t be as good as the real ones in that case.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ugh! I was looking forward to Foxy Friday - but this???
At least it&#039;s salvagable by the holy trilogy of hotness:

1. Ben Affleck in the Town (totally agree with you on this - I&#039;ve rewound the scene with the
pull-up bar so many times even my husband snapped at me)

2. Jonathan Toews (really, I&#039;ll take any opportunity to mention him - and THANKS for linking to his FF feature again - hello, nurse!)

3. Patrick Sharp - I think he really IS trying to keel you, Chuck. He&#039;s worth the double mention - and Joey had it right: &quot;Do you think you can be as beautiful as Patrick Sharp?&quot; John Scott: &quot;Uh, no, Joey - not a chance.&quot; Correct.]]></description>
