Where does one even start?

You have no idea how thrilled I am that I can just buy your future baby all sorts of Star Wars stuff and it&#039;ll be totally fine.

Darth Vader binkie, anyone?
or even better, this...

		<description><![CDATA[I wondered if your Babies R&#039; Us story was going to make an appearance here. I was grocery shopping yesterday and a mom was talking to her kid - who was like six months old - as if they were having a regular conversation. Scary.

Congrats to the Comries on their bun in the oven!]]></description>

And the sheer amount of stuff you can buy for babies... shiver and cringe.]]></description>
