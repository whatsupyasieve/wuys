		<description><![CDATA[Joey has only one question - and it&#039;s the most important question of all:

&quot;What&#039;s the most beautiful thing about you?&quot;

See? Super important.

This news about Sharpie staying in Chi-town for 5 years makes me sooooo happy. Tazer, Kaner, Hoss, Sharpie, Duncs AND Seabs? These hooligans will be making my hockey life for at least five more years. Provided nobody gets traded. But let&#039;s not talk about that.

And I&#039;m totally writing to Chicago magazine, starting the Sharpie/Tazer double cover issue campaigning. Pants, are you with me?]]></description>
