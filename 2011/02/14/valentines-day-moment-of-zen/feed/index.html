		<description><![CDATA[Dawn! You are absolutely going to hate me... I went shopping with a friend a couple weeks ago, and the mall was dead because of Bermuda Shorts Day. There was only one guy ahead of us in line... and guess who it was? I was standing behind Alex Tanguay!!! (I think he was buying a belt, but I was too focused on the fact that OMG IM STANDING BEHIND ALEX TANGUAY). He was wearing a skin tight blue underarmour shirt, and a black Nike Cap!!! He has very nice arms 8)
I was far too shy to say hello, so I just stood there blushing. He has a very charming smile.
Just thought I should let you know :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alex Tanguay traveled with the Flames to Denver and will be a game time decision tonight.  Holy fire drill, Batman.  Anyway, maybe he would have played if Forsberg was playing and I could have had my dream reunion.  Thanks for ruining everything, Peter!]]></description>

That thump you heard? Cassy passing out.

The Bergy/Bruins thing is bad enough, but now another team?
