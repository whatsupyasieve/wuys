		<description><![CDATA[Guilty as charged.  :)

Bergy was our #2 pick but Timmy won out because, well, he&#039;s TIMMAY!

I don&#039;t know if I&#039;d ever consider Ovi &quot;lovable&quot;.  Likeable?  Maybe.  He&#039;s is quite good at the hockey.  But Lovable?  Uh, no.  Mikey is WAY more loveable and huggable.

The Oilers selection - Linus Omark = best name!  Reminds me of Charlie Brown and the Peanuts. And who doesn&#039;t love the Peanuts.

I love MAF.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How sad is it that Nashville&#039;s supposedly most loved player is a guy that only got traded there three seconds ago? No love for Weber?

Also, I can say with some authority that Phaneuf is not the most loved player on the Leafs. Not by a loooong shot. (I mean, if we&#039;re talking D-men, top-hitter in the league and future franchise cornerstone Luke Schenn, hello?)

The picture of Patrick Kane is a pretty great illustration of his essential Kanerness though.]]></description>
