		<description><![CDATA[He is HOT HOT HOT ... Even with a belly! He is HOT. Mui caliente HOT! those eyes! If you keep this up, I swear I&#039;ll bombard the blog with nothing but photos of Ovi shirtless. The only thing stopping me is restraint. He doesn&#039;t wear underwear playing basketball either! TMI - I think NOT! eyes burning yet?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a relief to know she has SOME good taste in men, eh?

Teasing Dawn. But Ovi? Yes, my eyes are just fine tho I will admit earlier in the week he looked hot.

Then they tested my eyes with this headache thing and realised I had blurred vision and wasn&#039;t seeing properly. All fine now: back to being normally bad-looking to me! ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m going to have to go an an ALL CAPITALS OVI SHIRTLESS run if you keep this all Penguins post thing going. Mahwahaahahah and no, I am not a Penguins fan. Just a Kris Letang fan as all good hockey fans should be. For the record. Perhaps that was me with the voodoo doll ... Actually I don&#039;t want anyone hurt. If we win, I want it fair and square. It&#039;s not fun to gloat a win over a team that isn&#039;t at full force.]]></description>
