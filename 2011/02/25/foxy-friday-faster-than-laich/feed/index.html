		<description><![CDATA[Christ, that&#039;s even sexier/foxier if it&#039;s true! I love the name Evan. Totes.

Damn him and his pretty sapphire orbs of blue-ness. And he is waaaay sexier with cropped hair. He&#039;s so amazing ladies everywhere would pull it out if it was longer.

You ALL know what I mean :D.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, off the top of my head... Mike Peca, Mike Modano, Mike Green, Mike Comrie, Mike Fisher, Mike Richards... Ryan Miller, Ryan Kesler, Ryan Suter, Ryan Clowe, Ryan White, Ryan Callahan... Steve Yzerman, Steven Stamkos, Steve Downie.

Ok, not all those guys are Canadian, but. There&#039;s a reason NHLers all go by their last names instead of their given names. Same reason all the guys I went to school with did. :)

Other names on the list: Alex, Andrew, Patrick/Patrice, Brendan/Brandon.

I&#039;ve never met a Brooks in my life though. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t say he looked better with a shaved head. I just said he&#039;d put Mike Green to shame! Because what a mop! :0 But then all that hair would compete with those eyes and those strong facial features which I think would be a shame. ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Do these women get a handbook in the delivery room with a list and donâ€™t get past the Bâ€™s in Canada?&quot;
Little known fact: all Canadian women are provided with an NHL approved list of names at the maternity hospital. The first three names on the list are Mike, Ryan, and Steve.

Actually, I heard somewhere that Brooks Orpik is named after Herb Brooks. Don&#039;t know what the Laich family&#039;s excuse is.

I still think Brooks L. looks better with hair than the shaved head. Such a waste of a nice head of hair.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[God knows we all love a ladies&#039; man and Cassy loves herself Mr Blue-Eyed Brooksy here.  I have to admit checking the Caps&#039; scores to check if he scored a girl - NOTE this does NOT make me a Caps fan!

This really cheered me up today - thanks Dawn.  I just got in from the hospital and have this massive dressing over my lumbar puncture site.  Happy days.

I also heard that Brooksy has gone from &quot;single&quot; to &quot;dating&quot; to engaged - can I just say if it&#039;s the girl he was with at the WC, she&#039;s really lovely and that if he&#039;s kept this on the QT for a bit, it was the right decision.  Then again, I can also see him pulling a 360 and just proposing after 2 days.  Good luck to both of them - I DO hope you&#039;re very happy (but if she isn&#039;t good to you, baby, she should fear my wrath!)]]></description>
