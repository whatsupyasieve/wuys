		<description><![CDATA[What about breaking that team from Philly? And I am not talking about the Phillies. There are a few songs I cam sort of hear (Marilyn Manson poss) that might fit. But I&#039;ll need to find them when I get home. I am STILL in hospital.

Speaking of songs, &quot;I Predict a Riot&quot; is played by Leicester police, in their riot vans, on Friday/Saturday nights to psych themselves up for, er, drunken riots.

Now come to think of it, that&#039;s a bloody good song for a couple of teams recently who&#039;ve been a bit brawl-tastic....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ooh, this is fun.

Nine Inch Nails&#039; cover of Black Sabbath&#039;s &quot;Supernaut&quot; makes me want to smash the fuck out of everything within reach, but not out of rage - it&#039;s more like joyous destruction.  Like I would be laughing while punching if this was my fight song.]]></description>
