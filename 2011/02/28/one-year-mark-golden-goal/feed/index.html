		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s amazing how hockey isn&#039;t awesome anymore, according to 95% of the people I know. The Olympics are a magical thing...and as much as Americans wished for the gold, it just wasn&#039;t going to happen. Not if Sidney had any say.

Of course, I was rooting for the US...but I screamed in joy and jubilation when Sid scored in OT. Then, I was promptly disowned by a family who doesn&#039;t like hockey 1/59 as much as I do. I tried to explain to them that it HAD to be that way. Canada had to win. Sid had to score the golden goal. They don&#039;t get it.

...but seriously, Sid come back. We&#039;ve had enough. Staalsy can only get me through for so long.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My buddy was passing through town &#038; left in disgust when the game started. On live tv here! I just started talking hockey. Gone, baby gone. I did actually predict that USA would equalise right before the buzzer sending it to extra time... And that Sid would get the winning goal. I still wish I&#039;d placed a bet on that. I was also watching whilst covering my eyes so I nearly missed the goal. I didn&#039;t miss the rest of it or the closing ceremony though lol.

40 concussions is not good, but I&#039;ll happily share the other side of my bed given I&#039;m sick too with anyone that has made my top 5. Wait - that&#039;s like 2? Cuddles anyone?!]]></description>
