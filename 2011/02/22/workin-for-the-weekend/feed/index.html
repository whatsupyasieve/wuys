		<description><![CDATA[Agreed, Chuck. He&#039;s tied with Skinner for cuteness. Maybe if Jeff talked with a little kid accent, he&#039;d get a one-up. Let&#039;s work on that...

LOL @Cassy. I think the question would be &quot;What&#039;s the big deal with boys?&quot;. I read that PH post too. Maybe that has something to do with them being hot shots lately... ;)

Awh, feel better...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The big deal with girls? He better not ask the Hawks what with all the manlove going on (see Puck Huffers).

I am in hospital. If anyone sees the Briins get them to send me a goddamn fruit basket! They haven&#039;t fed me yet and flowers are banned.]]></description>

I love that kid.  I also love that he loves Coach Q&#039;s &#039;stache. It is pretty dope.]]></description>
