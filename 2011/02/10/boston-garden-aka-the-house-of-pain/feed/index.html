		<description><![CDATA[Imagine what Pants and I together would be like if I end up in the locale as well! Blue-blue eyes AND Fidget BOTH!

I&#039;ve only seen the highlights of that game thus far! Saving it as a weekend treat :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the kind words.  We want to spread the hockey love and if Mikey helps us to that, then we&#039;re totally okay with that.

Everyone loves TIMMAY!

Campbell beat Pyatt to a pulp.

Pants&#039; crush on Mikey is beginning to take on epic proportions.  I fear for him when she moves to the DC area soon...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tim and Carey&#039;s little pillow fight was fantastic. It was like the Diva matchup in the middle of a WWE fight, except with less cattiness and more giggling. I hate the Bruins but I love Timmy.

Also, I never noticed it watching the actual game, but in the replay - lol at Wiz&#039;s *flying leap* onto the melee along the boards. Amazing.

Seriously the craziest game I can remember. Campbell&#039;s son breaking Pyatt&#039;s face with his elbow pad at the end of the third kind of harshed my buzz though.

(BTW, this blog is great and not only because it enables my embarassing crush on Mike Green. Keep up the good work.)]]></description>
