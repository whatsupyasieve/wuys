		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t recall this incident, but I nearly screamed watching it.

#1: Ovi, get the eff off of Kris.  You goon.

#2: Bahahahaha, Backstrom and Tyler Kennedy.  I was thinking exactly what the commentators were - Nikky does NOT want to fight TK.  TK would mess him up something awful and then Mike would have to put him back together.

#3: Capitals, look around. Are you really going to start a fight when Brooks Orpik, Matt Cooke, Tyler Kennedy AND Jordan Staal are all on the ice?  REALLY?  (I kind of hope you do.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No worries - we love everyone here and keep it coming! Your secrets are safe here. I am the odd man out here too - HAHAHA I am OBSESSED with this development! Because I am tracking it. It&#039;s very weird. They seem to fight and then hang out. And they are my two favorite players because PANT MADE ME LOVE LETANG - she created the beast so she must live with the posts! It&#039;s my favorite MANWHICH!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So the first comment I left for you guys was under the name &quot;Seriously Pissed,&quot; and now I feel obligated to keep using it.  Please believe me when I say that I&#039;m not actually pissed off all of the time.  Just most of it.

This Ovi and Letang bromance is really messing with me.  I don&#039;t think I can maintain my dislike of Ovi if Letang thinks he&#039;s alright.  I can&#039;t tell any of my IRL friends this or they&#039;ll disown me so I have to make my confession to you guys.  And now I feel better.]]></description>
