		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t let it go ... I am OBSESSED! ;) But you secretly LOVE IT!

Fleury&#039;s face was PRICELESS but I didn&#039;t want to see Rick get hurt because he&#039;s a tasty treat, too hot for that face to get messed up and been too injured to suffer more. the only thing better would have been the pink pads!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the Penguins have been practicing the one-punch knockdown lately.  Either that or Jordan Staal bet Johnny he couldn&#039;t do it too.

Johnny was jealous of all the attention Flower is getting for being so adorable/hilarious/French/spontaneous.  This was the only available option!  Sorry to BU alum Ricky D, but don&#039;t try to fight with the big boys.  Maybe challenge Mike Green next time.

I adore goalie fights.  As Matty D said, it&#039;s like two guys fighting in those inflatable Sumo wrestling suits.

PS: &quot;...like Ovi on Kris Letang on a Sunday morning.&quot;  I just threw up in my mouth, Dawn!]]></description>
