		<description><![CDATA[Let&#039;s not forget about the Bruins now.

Timmay Thomas leads the NHL in every goaltending category.  (See http://www.nhl.com/ice/statshome.htm#?navid=nav-sts-league)

The line of Marchand/Recchi/Bergeron has been tearing it UP.  They put a serious hurting on the Stars last night 4 fights in first 5 minutes) and are playing some seriously good hockey right now.

Bergy was Foxy Friday and now he&#039;s playing like man possessed.  A coincidence?  I think not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hate summer. Too hot, or too wet and NO HOCKEY.

When I was a kid I went into a depression for 5 months when I couldn&#039;t skate.

&quot;But Cassy - it&#039;s sunny outside, go ride your bike or play with someone&quot;
&quot;No, Mom, I&#039;m going to stay inside in the shade reading this book till the rink re-opens and I get my skates re-sharpened. And I&#039;m not taking my parka and shades off either.&quot;]]></description>
