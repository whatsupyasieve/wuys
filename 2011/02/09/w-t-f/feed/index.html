		<description><![CDATA[I was about to say that even tho I&#039;m about to be in the nurse profession, even I didn&#039;t know concussion was catching. Truth is, everyone&#039;s taking them more seriously due to Sid an the ongoing Savvy saga.

And it IS better to be cautious and wait and see.  But neck strain much better than concussion for sure!

Shall we have a whip-round for a memory foam shaped one?]]></description>
