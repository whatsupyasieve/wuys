Will pop by the office later.  I want to see the view as you make him pick up things you &quot;accidentally&quot; dropped on the floor. MANY times. With my camcorder. Obviously.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am in serious like with Skinner these days, he&#039;s a cutie for sure. That hair, those bangs. He belongs in Georgetown with kakhis and topsiders.

BTW, does he NOT look like the dancing-through-the-hallway-singing kid (1:47) from the Belfast Giants Christmas video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzad9-Z0oTU) which might also be the same guy as singing-in-the-hairbrush star(0:44).

I think this should be incorporated into Skinner&#039;s intern duties.]]></description>
