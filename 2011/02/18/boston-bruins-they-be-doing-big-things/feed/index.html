		<description><![CDATA[I feel for anyone who has to face Boston&#039;s PP now. Kaberle feeding Chara? RUN AND HIDE.

Glad that this finally got done, and I think it&#039;s a good deal for both teams. Yeah, Kaberle&#039;s going into UFA, but he&#039;s a good guy, loyal soldier type (witness his fidelty through umpteen years of no playoff hockey in Toronto) and if Boston treats him well I don&#039;t know why he wouldn&#039;t stay. It would be nice to see him finally get a Cup.

On the other side, Colborne sounds like a bit of a project (needs to learn to make use of his size apparently?), but the Leafs are all about projects right now. More projects than a junior high science fair! Hopefully in three years or so it&#039;ll be blue ribbons out the wazoo, and not just some soggy bristol board and a baking soda volcano that fails to erupt.
Plus, a 1st round pick. Everyone loves those, even though it&#039;ll be late.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the nice words, Chris.

From all the reports that I am reading, the Bruins made this trade with the intentions of re-signing Kaberle at the end of the season.

Kaberle was just interviewed on the ice and he said that Bruins were his top choice to be traded to...which I think is a good sign.  Who knows - it could be a total lie, but I&#039;ll give him the benefit of the doubt.

I definitely feel that the Leafs are just looking to build up their young talent pool.  You&#039;re right - its a total wait and see sort of situation.  Let&#039;s talk in 3 years.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice post, really enjoyed the read. This Kaberle trade is definitely an interesting one as the Bruins are getting someone who is a free agent at the end of the season, so essentially he is a rental player. I&#039;m not a big fan of rental players because anything short of a stanley cup is a failure when you acquire a rental player so even though they have two 1st rounders we don&#039;t know if giving away these prospects and draft picks could come back to haunt the Bruins. Kaberle is a very solid player, but the Leafs must have been happy to get a pretty solid package for him. I think the Leafs did a very good job with the trade and it could even be one of those win-win types of trades. But only time will tell I guess.  Also, you think you could check out my blog cuz I&#039;d love to hear what you have to say. http://chrisross91.wordpress.com/2011/02/18/brian-burke-is-too-confusing]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s some good changes, tho as I said to you earlier i thought it would be Ryder that went.

All we have to do now is wait and see how it all gels together. But, yeah, magic! And my teddy, Patrice (also on FB) is as happy as this Scottish Bear!! And you!]]></description>
