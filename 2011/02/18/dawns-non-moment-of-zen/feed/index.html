		<description><![CDATA[That is HILARIOUS! I kind of figured that from watching his DVD. And seeing the team in SJ. Perrault (sp) was TEENY! It doesn&#039;t matter. I heart him - I am not a fair weather fan. I still want my Ovi/Letang sammy! ;) THANK YOU for the sighting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t want to break your heart... she said he has a beer gut.  Ovi was wearing a tshirt and his &quot;8&quot; hat, so she knew it was him, although she would have easily recognized him without the 8.  She didn&#039;t say one way or another if he was hot, but her taste in guys is generally poor.  Well, her boyfriend is actually really cute, but she also has a crush on Paul Martin.  Martin?  Seriously?  He looks like he should coach girl&#039;s high school basketball.  I don&#039;t think he&#039;s horrible-looking but no way would I say he&#039;s hot.

She also said that none of them were as big as you might expect.  They&#039;re not giants.  They&#039;re almost like regular guys.  And they started throwing down some big money so none of her friends could play craps anymore.  And she and all of her friends were all wearing Pens shirts, so it was all kind of surreal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You won&#039;t believe this... my sister was just at the Casino here in Pittsburgh to watch the Pens game.  She was at the craps table when she realized that OVI WAS STANDING NEXT TO HER.  There were other Caps there too - I think she said Perreault and Fehr, and some admin type people.  She said she he caught her looking at him and kind of laughed, but she was too freaked out to say anything, and then security came and kind of built a wall around the Caps so that was it.  She also said her boyfriend tried to take a picture but the casino security yelled at him because apparently you&#039;re not allowed to take photos in casinos.  The moral of this story - if your sister asks if you want to go to the casino, SAY YES.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[His mom is a two-time Olympic gold medalist in basketball which is pretty fricken awesome so it&#039;s not like it&#039;s completely random. He lost his older brother in a car acident when he was about ten which I can&#039;t imagine have happening. While I agree he probably has a HUGE ego, he does have the talent to back it up and he is VERY loyal to his true friends. Plus, honestly - NO ONE seems to have as much fun playing hockey as he does. He truly loves the game.

Mr. Cherrie has to put up with it because if he doesn&#039;t - he doesn&#039;t get to watch hockey at home! I&#039;ll make him watch Gossip Girl! LOL! I love me some Chuck Bass! This way, every one get&#039;s what they want. ;)

I&#039;m so glad you found us!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just found that out too - I thought he was a mega douche because he always wears his number - like on his hat, and I think he has a big gold chain with an &quot;8&quot; on it.  And I thought, wow, is this guy&#039;s ego so huge that he has to wear his number all of the time?  To me it was as lame as wearing a shirt with your own name on it.  No one is awesome enough to pull that off.  But then I heard it was his mom&#039;s number and it made it okay somehow.  Not completely okay - but less egotistical than I thought and better than a tattoo that says &quot;mom.&quot;

And I love this blog.  It&#039;s so nice to have somewhere to get all of my hockey crushes out of my system.  Mr. Pissed doesn&#039;t especially like hearing about them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bless you and I love you blog name. I want to steal it! I feel a kindered spirit in you. HA! :) Mr. Cherrie laughs every time he reads your comments. Honestly, I think Ovi cultivates the &#039;bad boy&#039; image - but who really knows. When we were in Canada they kept yelling Mama&#039;s Boy at me and I had no idea why until I stopped someone and who did and asked. Then they said because he wear&#039;s his mom&#039;s number! AHAHAHHA! So how bad can he be?]]></description>
