		<description><![CDATA[*fallsdowndead*

Oh. My.  God.
This is my new favorite commercial.  Not only does it have Rick being ridiculously foxy and lumberjacky (sledgehammer vs. tire!) but it also has Ty-Ty Seguin looking hotter than he should.

Pants loves when Toews does squats.  I love when Seguin throws medicine balls.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh my god. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I think we should be friends. Nash-ty has provided fodder for my hockey/lumberjack fantasies for quite some time now. Not to brag - I get every Columbus game on TV here! The only perk of living in Ohio? Ha!

He is forever the cause of my sexual frustration. Again, THANK YOU!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chuck, I hate to break it to you, but I live in the land of REAL lumberjacks and you are more than welcome to come visit and meet them but you will be VERY disappointed. Better to keep your fantasy alive. Because living the dream means the REAL Forks, WA and sister, you will be VERY disappointed. 4th grade education, no teeth, B.O., barefoot and pregnant. No Rick Nash in sight sister! TRUST ME .... More sasquatch than Nashsquatch!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Those jeans ARE illegal in most of the 50 states I think. Mmmm mmmm mmmm.  Rick IS foxy, even with porcupine hair.

And your whole lumberjack thing reminded me of something, which given the title of the previous post, suddenly seems all appropriate, like.

Enjoy, Chuck!
