		<description><![CDATA[Nicky got an actual punch in which floored me because his more known for HIS slashing. But I am sure there was no whining involved from letang. I agree with Pants. I think they were fighting over who had better hair and I have to side with Mr. letang on this one. I will run my finger through that any day although, nicky does have the edge on the euro dutch boy look.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well... as long as you know.  :)

Also, it is painful for me to make fun of my favorite player, but it must be done.  Anyone else laughing at Letang for whining to the refs after he punched Backstrom in the face?  Like wtf is he saying?  He hit me first, after I slashed him and broke his thumb?]]></description>
