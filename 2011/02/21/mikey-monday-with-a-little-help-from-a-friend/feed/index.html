		<description><![CDATA[*wild cheering!* Pants is back yay!

We know what Dawn will be doing; feeding Ovi as-peeled-by-IJS-grapes whilst clad in a Greek-style tunic, as Ovi lounges on a couch, all while a pouting IJS is forced to fan Ovi with a giant palm leaf, Greek-style tunic of his own not entirely optional. Pants will be listening to Mikey tell her about his Muppet trauma and she&#039;ll be gazing into his eyes and stroking his brow as he also relates his aftermath symptoms.

Chuck and I will be in the corner of the offices alternately rolling on the floor laughing or gazing at Pants very jealous before we make a bid for freedom and go find the Professor and Savvy for our own afternoon of fun!]]></description>

Mikey won&#039;t play today vs. Pittsburgh, but says he&#039;ll play Friday against the Rangers.  I&#039;m not going to say anything for fear of jinxing today&#039;s game.  GO PENS.  I&#039;m back in the light.]]></description>
