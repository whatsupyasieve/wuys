		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Here&#8217;sÂ my original post aboutÂ myÂ descent into madness.Â The more IÂ got to know theÂ Caps,Â the more I liked them. Then I moved to the DC area. I went to my first Caps game two days later and watching my new &#8220;home&#8221; team,Â I couldn&#8217;t help hoping they did well. Not thatÂ well, but you know. Just a little well. Is that so bad?

		<description><![CDATA[Your love for Mike is clouding your brain...

I think that it is okay for you to like Mike and cheer for him, but I don&#039;t know about this &quot;cheering for the Caps as a team&quot; thing.

Unacceptable.]]></description>
