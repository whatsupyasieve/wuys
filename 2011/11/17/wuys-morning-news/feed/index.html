And there&#039;s nothing sexier than the Hawks beating the Nucks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I live in DC when I&#039;m not at college and I must admit I&#039;d cheer for the Pens any day over the Caps no matter how pretty Mike Green and his Lamborghini are. Hope the Pens pull this out! Too bad I won&#039;t be home from college yet. Lame.

Also hoping Baby Seguin keeps up the great work...he becomes more and more attractive with each point he gets and the higher his plus/minus rating gets!]]></description>
