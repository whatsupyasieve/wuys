		<description><![CDATA[I totally agree with Lindsey but I love the Leafs. Conn Smythe said that the name of the regiment was a proper noun, Maple Leaf Regiment so the plural would be to just add an &#039;s.&#039; So many people think the Leafs butchered grammar.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So full of Canadian historical information, Linds!  We might let you borrow the Professor&#039;s elbow-patch jacket.  (Okay, Cassy will never allow that. But you get the idea.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you, thank you, thank you.

I have a soft spot for the Leafs and I ADORE Luke. Such a cutie, and I can&#039;t say I mind watching him throw guys around like he did in the fight vs. Clarkson...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Luke Schenn! Who knew you were such a cutie pie?! Clearly, Pants.

And he&#039;s from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan - my native province! Carter can attest to the ridiculousness of Canadian town names - anything from Saskatchewan is on that list.

Finally, sticking up for the Leafs might get my citizenship revoked, but they&#039;re the Maples Leafs (not Leaves) for a reason - named in honour after the Maple Leafs Regiment from WWI.

Happy birthday Luke!]]></description>
