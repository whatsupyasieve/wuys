		<description><![CDATA[Also!  Michalek is back tonight also.  The Pens roster is almost 100%; we are just missing Lovejoy but they don&#039;t play him every game anyway.  So the Islanders will be the first NHL team to face the Pens in their pure form.  I almost feel bad for them.  Hahaha just kidding.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Merry Sidmas!

As a die hard Flyers fan, I&#039;m probably going to get stoned (and not the fun kind) on Broad Street for saying this, but I&#039;m really looking forward to seeing him return...oh, and for getting to activate him from IR on my fantasy team and watch the points tally!

I&#039;d really hate to be the first opponent who makes contact with Sid]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve read you blog for a while and never got the nerve to comment. I thought THIS would be a perfect opportunity. I had been going back and forth with my friends about going to the islanders game and thought it probably wouldn&#039;t be worth it. I changed my holiday plans and left for NC a couple days early. I am kicking myself right now!

-So wonderfully happy right now though!]]></description>
