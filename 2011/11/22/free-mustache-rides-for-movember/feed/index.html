		<description><![CDATA[Weeeeellll, I favour the clean-shaven in my personal life. But it&#039;s been so long since I&#039;ve seen Doughty clean-shaven, I can&#039;t even imagine what he might look like. And I&#039;m sure he&#039;ll have time to give rides once he&#039;s been Shanabanned.]]></description>
