		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t cry, but last night...I almost broke down.  To see someone love his sport/profession/passion like Sid does, well it&#039;s just an inspiration to all.   And I screamed so loud at his first goal that my neighbors came running out of their house.  I was yelling &quot;f&#038;ck yeah&quot; along with Sid, everyone at Consul Energy Center, and all hockey loving fans who were glued to their TV sets.

Hockey is an awesome sport, but it&#039;s just that much better with Sid back.

And thanks WUYS.  Love you guys!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had goosebumps leading up to the game and then they just turned to chills running down my spine for the entire game.
I am so unbelievably happy he&#039;s back. I missed him so much!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I admit, I shed a few tears. I didn&#039;t realize how much I missed him until the return. The &#039;stache (as awful as it is) reminds me that he is picking up basically where he left off. :)]]></description>
