		<description><![CDATA[Oh Pants, what did you do? Didn&#039;t they give you the &quot;right&quot; locker room candystriper first aid course? Do I need to start remedial office classes in how to &quot;help&quot; them without leaving them with injury? I&#039;m sure Intern Jeff Skinner will volunteer for demonstrations ( or there may be &quot;restraints&quot; in my bottom desk drawer- you still have the spare key, right?)

And Nicky singing along to Pitbull? Not THAT Pitbull song?! NO! *dies*]]></description>
