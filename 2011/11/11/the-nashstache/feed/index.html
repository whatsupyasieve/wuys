		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s hard to tell in that photo, but Tazer is also participating in No-Shave November as well. Small blessings that he can&#039;t ACTUALLY grow a moustache, but he really needs to take care of whatever is happening at the back of his neck.

http://video.blackhawks.nhl.com/videocenter/console?catid=690&#038;id=134243

Of course... OF COURSE Movember happens when I have paid painfully unnecessary amounts of money to see him twice in one week. Seriously Jonny, shave for next Saturday&#039;s game in Edmonton? Pretty please?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, no. No, no, no. It just doesn&#039;t work. I never thought he&#039;d be Unattractive, but put the porn stache on him and stick him next to Taxed and well?

I will wait for you, Rick. You&#039;ve been patient with Columbus, so it&#039;s the least I can do.

By the way, I feel like I just got inducted into the WUYS Hall of Fame. Nothing can top this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[New to the site...love love love it. Feeling the opposite of love love love for the Nashstache. I felt gutted when I saw it a few days ago. I even made my daughter come out of her room in order to look at before and after photos. (She grimaced. Atta girl.) I knew Nash&#039;s beard had a delightful effect on me but I had no idea it was a MAGIC beard. Egads.]]></description>
