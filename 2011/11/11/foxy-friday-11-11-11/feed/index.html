		<description><![CDATA[He&#039;s just sooooo Jordan.

Enough said.

Can we recruit Zachary to record what IJS is saying in his sleep? I am concerned that confidential office information, like how to tie a Windsor is getting out into the public domain.  Either that or IJS is only allowed to sleep at one of our paces for &quot;security&quot; reasons.

I said security. I am not a dirty old woman!

Oh, ok then, just less of the old ;)]]></description>
