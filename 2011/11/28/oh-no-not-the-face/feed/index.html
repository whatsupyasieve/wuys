I do think it&#039;s harsh since it&#039;s sort of like getting a traffic ticket in the mail but that&#039;s water under the bridge. Tanger&#039;s a man hopefully he&#039;ll be OK - oh god I hope so. Looking for photos. Will let you know. He mights sort of look hot. We&#039;ll see!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was out at a bar with my sister and I thought I was going to start crying right there.  Or vomit.  Or both.  I think I might have been hysterical because I didn&#039;t move or make a sound for like 2 solid minutes.  Then when he came back out on the ice I almost flipped the table over, and when he scored that goal I pretty much burned down the entire bar.  Or shouted.  I don&#039;t know, I get those two mixed up all of the time.

BTW Max got three games.  The unbiased hockey fan in me thinks that&#039;s harsh, but the Letang fan in me thinks that&#039;s hardly enough for jeopardizing his future modeling career.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[yeah ... it put me beind at work but it was worth it! LOL! Max did have a hearing about it but honestly, if it wasn&#039;t called on the ice, I don&#039;t think there should be a hearing. Shannahammer is OOC. He needs to let them play. Letang took the hit like a man. It&#039;s hockey. Tanger&#039;s had his own Shannahammer-o-rammer-dammers too. ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been waiting for this all day. From you. Appropriate Dawn reaction. I had the game live but went to bed (5 hr time difference people!) Then roomie distracted me from this.

Has Pacioretty (who should know better about cheap shots of both verbal and physical varieties) been Shanabanned yet? And KUDOS KRIS! Game winner yeah!

[sees end. Spots bit about modelling. Sputters. Coughs]

*Folds hands in prayer* Please, god, let him model underwear for Calvin Klein. Or his own line. Just underwear.]]></description>
