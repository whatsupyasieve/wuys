		<description><![CDATA[March Mocassin Madness!

http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/510379/mike_green.jpg

PS - Movember makes my eyes so sad. Although, I think Mikey might be one of the only one who can get away with unnecessary facial hair. Also on this list, Patrick Sharp (aka the Jon Hamm of Hockey) whose 7 o&#039;clock shadow is a thing of sheer beauty.

PPS - Always glasses Mikey, always. I&#039;m not super up on my Caps roster... who&#039;s behind him in that pic? He looks like a blurry Henry Cavill.]]></description>
