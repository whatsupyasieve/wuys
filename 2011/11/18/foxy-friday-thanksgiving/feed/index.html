		<description><![CDATA[Is it sad that I&#039;ve been mulling this over for (literally) the whole weekend? Anyhow, here goes:

1. Brooks Laich (obviously)
2. Jonathan Ericsson (Detroit&#039;s finest)
3. Kris Letang (I mean, even the middle-aged male announcers are obsessed with him)
4. Jordin Tootoo (there are a surprising number of shirtless photos of him on the web, all of which are amazing)
5. Brent Seabrook (Veronica, I&#039;m jealous)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really want to ditto Lindsay&#039;s first list! It was hard to narrow it down to just 5 but here it goes...

1. Jonathan Toews...sigh..his eyes, his voice, his body, oh yeah, and he can play some hockey too...leads the league in face offs won...I would lose the draw against him too since I would be too busy staring at him to even notice the puck.
2. Jeff Skinner...our little intern continues to defy gravity on the ice as he skates circles around the opposing team...not to mention he plays on one of the coolest named lines in the NHL...&quot;Finns and Skins&quot; line!
3. Whoever said Marc Savard you are alright in my book! Unfortunately the Matt Cooke voodoo doll is not working like it should....damn you MC for ending Savvy&#039;s career!
4. Brent Seabrook...I had a nickname I gave him when he played for the Norfolk Admirals...yummy thighs...he sat down next to me on a couch in the hotel lobby....all I could do was stare at his amazing thighs...sigh
5. Stammer...I have to say he has grown on me since I have started reading your blog...he&#039;s not bad to look at either!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, Pants. This is why I love you. As would be expected, my list is fairly Penguin-centric.

1. Sid. Self-explanatory. He is hockey to me.
2. Geno. The Russian angel of my dreams.
3. Jordan Staal. Quite a season for my #3 so far.
4. Rick Nash. Quite a testament to his character that he stays in my beloved Columbus. Also, the lumberjack detail.
5. Jonathan Toews. That face. That voice. That talent.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My top 5:
1. Rick Nash:  The first hockey player I ever loved (y&#039;know, way back to a whole year ago when I got into hockey).  Gotta respect (and question the sanity) of a man with talent like that who remains true to his team.
2. Brooks Laich: He changes tires for fans, is a 2-way forward, plays D in a pinch, and re-signed with the Caps because he couldn&#039;t stand to be away from his friends.
3. Mike Green: Who doesn&#039;t love pooh bear?  Also, he thinks I&#039;m nice, so I&#039;ll return the favor there.
4. Danny Briere: Though the NHL says he&#039;s 5&#039;10&quot; (and having been to Flyers practice, I&#039;ll give him that...when he&#039;s on the ice in skates...it&#039;s really more like 5&#039;4&quot;), that man can play like someone who&#039;s a foot taller.
5. Flower: He&#039;s got talent and personality!  He stands on his head (literally sometimes) and he&#039;s racking up fantasy points for my team like nobody&#039;s business :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If I had to do my top 5 it would be:

1. Mike Green because he&#039;s Mike Green and that&#039;s all we need to know.
2. James Neal. Because he&#039;s now a Pen AND cuddles dogs.
3. Jonathon Toews. I&#039;m from Chicago so he just HAS to be on the list.
4. Rick Nash. Burly, facial hair full of goodness
5. Sid the Kid for the sake of his oh shucks, OCDish, full lips full of goodness.

Honorable mention: Max Talbot because he is the epitome of swagger]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My top 5? Just 5? Ok then...

1. TIMMMMMAYYYY Thomas. Do ya need to ask why?
2. The Professor for being a workhorse and example. And, well, FOXY.
3. Mr Blue Blue Eyes, #21, Brooks Laich himself, for being the Caps&#039; answer to Bergy and [censored thought]
4. Sid the Kid Crosby. Because I have bad, bad thoughts.
5. Marc Savard. Blue eyes again. Bruins AGAIN. Just...well...I&#039;d fight Chuck for him. I would. ;)

I love you Intern Jeff Skinner, but you&#039;re just so young I blush when you bend over in the office, but a pat on the head for keeping my secret stash of watchamacallit bars stocked up and practising your Windsor knot!

PS brining both pecan and pumpkin pie to this shindig, but remember to go easy on the egg-nog. I can&#039;t remember how much booze I put in it...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[THAT picture of Neal? I would have thought you&#039;d use the &quot;Neal goes Hawaii Five-O&quot; gem. They called it &quot;awesomely bad&quot;, but where I am from we call it &quot;Tuesday&quot;. I remember the Ugly Christmas Sweater Party the Pens had a few years back. Wearing one of THOSE for a week should be the REAL punishment for the loser of the shootout!
And my list:
1) LeBang
2) LeBang
3) LeBang
4) LeBang
5) LeTang]]></description>
