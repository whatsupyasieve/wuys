		<description><![CDATA[Lindsay can confirm... I have been text-shouting &quot;PATRICK KANE BE MY BOYFRIEND!!&quot; all day. Actually, it started last night when I found out he was boyfriend material... and then I ate some Twizzlers.  But this commercial sealed the deal. For now (as in until there is new footage of Jonathan Toews playing golf at the Hawks Dad&#039;s Trip), Kane &#062;&#062;&#062;&#062; Toews. And I NEVER thought I would say that.]]></description>

Every single Twizzler in my bag was defective - zero had holes all the way through for maximum straw possibilities.  This was a serious problem.

		<description><![CDATA[While we&#039;re not going to post a photo of Kaner&#039;s girl, let us just say she is ADORABLE.  She is 100% more adorable, respectable and nice looking than we might have expected (bad WUYS for thinking otherwise).  Applause all around!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I HAVE to comment on this post - PKane, I LOVE YOU! Damn, he looks so good in that commercial.

WUYS - haven&#039;t you heard the news? Kaner has a girlfriend now - apparently it was in a pre-game video and then Tumblr exploded. No more getting drunk and picking up chicks now - Kane just hangs out with his lady and eats Twizzlers (no, for serious, that&#039;s what he said).

If it keeps him from punching cab drivers and missing practices with hangovers, I&#039;m ecstatic. Candy for everyone!!]]></description>
