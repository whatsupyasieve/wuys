		<description><![CDATA[Tomorrow is Canada Day. And rather than celebrating being Canadian by drinking my face off, I&#039;ll be glued to my iPhone and computer in rural BC, desperately following the UFA dealings. And drinking. Really, it&#039;s the only way to get through it.

It&#039;s going to be the most bi-polar day of my life - likely weeping into a drink if (when?) Talbot is traded, and hopefully rejoicing if the Hawks sign someone awesome (Richards? Kidding!). Nothing like celebrating my country&#039;s 144th birthday than with Bob McKenzie, Darren Dreger and Twitter!]]></description>
