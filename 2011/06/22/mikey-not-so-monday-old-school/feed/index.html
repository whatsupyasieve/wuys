		<description><![CDATA[If we ever meet in person please remind me or CVP (@MercurialWinger) or KPR (@KP_Row ) how we ran into Brooks Laich at the 2010 car show that resulted in him asking us to go to the &quot;garage&quot; with him. KPR was cool and got a photo with him whereas I just stood in the corner fanning myself. Reason why we gave for not going to the garage with him: &quot;we needed to see the other guys&quot; and had to witness that horrible MG52 hair in person. BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I bet he and his hetero life partner, Nicky B, are hitting the dance joints and giving the Hiltons a run for their money on the poles!

Can I say that on your blog? Oops.

Poor Mikey - that hair really is a trial to him. Bets on when he does a Brooks?! But could he rock it? Hmmm]]></description>
