		<description><![CDATA[I can also confirm that. CUTE. As in makes me feel so, so wrong lusting after someone HALF MY AGE.

So I then look at pics of the Professor (ditto, double guilt) and then settle for #91 (sorry Chuck), who&#039;s only a couple years younger then I feel better!

Or Michael Ryder. 5 years is fine and I so like that hole Viking thing he has going on...]]></description>

You both look gorgeous! I love the fascinators. And I can only imagine what would/could have happened if Ty-Ty had been shirtless at your wedding...

And the hockey players as kids tumblr made my week when Puck Daddy posted the link.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[:)  We try. *bows gracefully*

I&#039;m totally fine with him forgetting his shirt.  In fact, I may sneak into his house and steal all his wonderfully fitted t-shirts.  Oops sorry Tyler.  Looks like you&#039;ll have to spend the summer topless.  For shame.

He and Brad are the youngest on the team so it only seems natch that they&#039;d hang out together.  Everyone else is married or has a GF so Seggie and Wolverine are living the life and getting as much tail as they can.]]></description>

Poor Ty-Ty - he&#039;s still only a teenager, but just imagine what his Cup day/party is going to be like. Help.

Party on dude! But mayhap not with BM, &#039;K? I&#039;ve not heard any rubies from my side of the Pond, but now I&#039;m starting to worry...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m doing a slow golf clap over here ladies. Sweet tea vodka and lemonade apres DJ departure? Congratulations, you are my heroes.

Congratulations on your wedding, Pants! Can we call you Mrs. Pants now?

And while I&#039;ve been LOOOOOOVING how Baby Seguin&#039;s been forgetting shirts lately (because, sometimes it just slips your mind!) I&#039;m a little worried about how much he&#039;s been hanging with Brad Marchand. What was the Tweet I saw about BM from @RunsOnDuncan?

&quot;Brad Marchand combines the rapping talent of Versteeg with the drinking talent of Patrick Kane, all with a nose from his dad, Ringo Starr.&quot;

Stay safe Baby Seguin - maybe a summer with Taylor Hall will prevent you from punching a cab driver?]]></description>
