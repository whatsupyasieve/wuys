		<description><![CDATA[He is adorbs. I&#039;m a total creep for getting excited when he says &quot;Cut! I&#039;m changing.&quot; WTF is wrong with me?

YES!!! Ketchup chips are a Canadian thing and they are DELICIOUS. I&#039;m going to be in Washington next year, Pants. I&#039;ll be bringing several bays to the WUYS for the team to enjoy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agreed!  Forget Stamkos.  We know he&#039;s adorbs and all with his blond hair and boyish grin, but this Jari character - he&#039;s fantastic!

I agree with Lindsay, he needs a show ASAP.

AHNBELIVEABLE!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pants, that&#039;s enough. I cannot handle all of these workout videos you&#039;re posting of our favourite boys! Instead of feeling like a fattie (because really - who CAN jump that high?!) I&#039;m just feeling fluttery like a schoolgirl.

Side note - Jari deserves his own television show. ASAP.]]></description>
