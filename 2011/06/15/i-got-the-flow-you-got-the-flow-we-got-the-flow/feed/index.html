		<description><![CDATA[Shi spoke my mind for me. Honest. I&#039;ll leave out the fact I&#039;m biased as hell as well to boot.

I mean it&#039;s all wavy and gorgeous - no needing a hairdryer for the bouffant look eh?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kane&#039;s is a an alternative to a playoff beard because the poor kid&#039;s face is smoother than a baby&#039;s ass, and only stuck around for one round. So he&#039;s out. Gretzky, Jagr, and McSorley... the 80&#039;s. Let&#039;s be real, back then the mullet then was less about hockey and more about fashion. Barry Melrose ditched his mullet for the Team Iceland slick back, so he&#039;s out for being a quitter. Iafrate scares me. So the only one left is McQuaid who wears his mullet with pride today in 2011 and doesn&#039;t give a damn. His mullet deserves its own foxy friday for sheer awesomeness.]]></description>
