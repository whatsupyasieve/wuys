		<description><![CDATA[So beyond happy right now &#038; my best friend had a baby boy this morning too! I suggested Stanley as a suitable name; gotta remind her of all other good names: Cam, Claude, Mark, Patrice, David, Michael, Tyler etc...

Saw the whole thing live. Am exhausted and on my way to work in my new Eastern Conference Tshirt.

Wish I was going to be in Boston for the Cup parade! Lucky Chuck!!!]]></description>
