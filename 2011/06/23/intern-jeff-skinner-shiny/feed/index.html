		<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s up with Intern Jeff&#039;s summer?  Where&#039;s the Calder sitting these days?  Are you using it as your coffee mug or cereal bowl?

Are you still fetching lunch from the roach coach for the gurls?

We miss you Jeffie!  Post soon!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so proud of you, Jeffy!  We&#039;re so proud of you!  Sparkling cider toasts for everyone!

In honor of your achievement, overall adorable-ness, and your dimples, I&#039;m all for giving you a weekly stipend.  Pants might be a little miffed at you beating Logan, but don&#039;t worry about her.  I&#039;ll give her a few Whatchamacallit bars and she&#039;s forget all about it.

How does $100 a week sound?  Should be enough for Mountain Dew and twizzlers, right?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We love you Jeff! And congrats on winning the Calder... those of us who have some swing made damn sure that all your additional Intern work on top of being Rookie of the Year swayed the final result, even if you DID beat Logan Couture, the Rookie of Pants&#039; Life.

I&#039;m making you a special poster chart here, with stickers.  It&#039;s got all the awards, trophies and medals you could win on it.  I expect you to use a sticker to fill every single box as you win them.

Go get &#039;em tiger! Get on it...

PS Ladies, should we get the Intern an intern? I&#039;d like to recommend Couturier, who I am adopting as the Rookie of MY Life :D]]></description>
