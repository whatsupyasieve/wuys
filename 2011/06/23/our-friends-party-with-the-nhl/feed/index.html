Perry could walk around without being molested. Toews&#039;s entourage was getting ALL the play. ALL of it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Haha - thanks. But if you saw the mess I was, I can assure you I wouldn&#039;t be your hero. I took three hours of being smushed by a mob of groupies and finally he came to the edge of his booth and I accidentally on purpose backed into him. WORTH IT.  And yes, while Jon Hamm is undoubtedly HANDSOME YEARS-OLD, Toews... Toews... Is BEWITCHING.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[And all I managed last year was a few drinks with the Bruins coaches in Belfast. Sigh.

I&#039;m so in. Might need forward planning, but let&#039;s pack our best frocks.

Am uber awed by the fact you guys were AT this party (looking stunning I might add). Wow. Kudos!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The composure is an illusion, I assure you. Also, it should be noted that Jeff Skinner does not touch girls. He poses with his hand clenched into a fist and holds his arm at least 6&quot; away. Tried to sneak a pic from the side when he was posing with Jennifer Beals. Cutest thing EVER. Such a good boy. (*cough Tyler Seguin I&#039;m looking your way cough*)

Also, Toews didn&#039;t show to this classy party, but he did hold court at the after-after party at the club later that night. He was remarkably well behaved despite being surrounded by women who were, erm... (no kind words). And also his friends are really hot. I did not get a picture (save for a blurry, indistinguishable one) because I was too busy dying a million fangirl deaths. I rubbed elbows with him. Not figuratively, my elbow literally bumped his elbow. DEATH. He. Is. So. Beautiful. Spectacular. Phenomenal. So much so that he completely nullified the fact that Jon Hamm was also at this party. That&#039;s right, I said it.

Pants - we are so on for next year. I&#039;m already packed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Deep breaths....Omigod. I had no idea I&#039;d be this fangirl freakout over the awards. Srsly - Jonathan Toews was at this party?? I&#039;m equal parts horrified there&#039;s no photos and feeling faint. Whew.....

I&#039;m so hopped up from the awards that I&#039;ll have to wait to comment on the overall Awards post. Damn you, Pants for including that hawt pic of JT. Now I&#039;ve got to keep working for the rest of the day?? Jeez.

This is the last year that Vegas is guaranteed to have the awards - apparently they&#039;re looking into LA or NYC as possible options for 2012. Wherever it is, I&#039;m in for next year - I&#039;ll follow Tazer wherever he goes. This is an illness for sure.]]></description>
