		<description><![CDATA[Damn it Chuck, with that perfect post you made me teary eyed and wibble again!

The Finals made the news here in the UK for the wrong reason; the riots. I feel for the Nucks &#038; their fans; Luongo let them down.

Wish I was going to be at the Cup Parade. I really do. And I reckon their run started in Belfast, but you know why lol!

Just got my Eastern Conference Champs Tshirt. Damn it now I need another one!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What a poignant post. I&#039;m so thrilled for you Chuck and all the B fans around the world for this moment. It was amazing to see the change in the Bruins after the terrible hit on Horton. The critics all said they couldn&#039;t do it - that Vancouver was more talented, skilled, that it was inevitable they&#039;d win. But you&#039;re right - that kind of stuff doesn&#039;t matter in the playoffs. And it didn&#039;t matter tonight.

The post-game rioting in Vancouver has in some ways - certainly in Canada - overshadowed what the Bruins accomplished. For the fine people of Vancouver, and the many Canucks fans who aren&#039;t sociopaths, it&#039;s a shame. This is what I want to remember when I think of the 2011 Stanley Cup Champions - the love, the team, the spirit.]]></description>
