		<description><![CDATA[Me missed Savvy too :(. Loved the water thing :D.

What always sets us aside is we don&#039;t seem to have prima donnas - we really are a team and the guys are as genuine and nice as as they seemas are the coaches. They just believe in each other. It&#039;s so obvious. You should see them out together ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just seeing NH18 made my heart hurt.  So amazing.

They loves each other.  Not as overtly or as goofy as say the Caps or Pens but there is love just the same.

Apparently some of the guys didn&#039;t even know that he did that until after the game.

Only bear missing from that celebration was Marc Savard.  :-(]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OMG. The cries of &quot;We did it!&quot; - amazing. Putting aside my Canucks distain momentarily, I can still say for a fact that this team just totally deserved to win. Such a bond between the players - so much love.

Plus did you see Horty pour water from TD Gardens onto the ice at Rogers Arena before the game? My favourite moment of this series. Love, love, love.]]></description>
