		<description><![CDATA[Ohhhhhhhh my GOD!!!!! I&#039;m squealing like a school girl in my office. WHAT? Mike Green AND Duncan Keith? Boy, if I wasn&#039;t motivated to undertake project stalking MG52 &#039;11, this is the final push. DUNCAN KEITH spends his summers in Calgary too? Sure, he might run like a goober (sorry, Duncs), but I just can&#039;t resist his hillbilly accent.

The squats of Greener with the weights *might* be better than Tazer&#039;s (sorry, Pants) - so good that instead of watching Game 6 tonight, I&#039;ll be staked outside of Crash Conditioning, which is only 20 MINUTES FROM MY HOUSE.

Holla - I&#039;m out!]]></description>
