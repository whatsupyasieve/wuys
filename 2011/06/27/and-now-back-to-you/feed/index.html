		<description><![CDATA[It is OFFENSIVE how good looking he is. Smart of Vancouver to draft him - especially after all the trade talks over last season. Seriously, I was hoping he could get traded so I could cheer for him. Damnit! Now I&#039;ll keep having to hate on the Canucks and secretly (OK, not so secretly with this comment on the Internet) lust after him. And Kesler. I just wish they would be nicer to Jonathan Toews. Leave our boy alone!]]></description>
