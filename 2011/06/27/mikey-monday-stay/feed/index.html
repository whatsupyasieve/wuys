		<description><![CDATA[We are keeping Brooks thankfully...but there is a lot of talk out there that Mikey&#039;s days in DC are numbered.  This is the most depressing statement I&#039;ve uttered in a long time.  It&#039;s giving me lots of anxiety...what would we do without him here in Washington...he&#039;s so pretty.  I guess I&#039;ll have to look forward to Mikey Mondays even more so.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Please god no! You checking that website daily?! I am. If he goes on the open Market, he&#039;ll be snapped up faster than you can say &quot;epic bromance&quot;. PS I&#039;d faint if confronted with that unholy/godly duo.

Now I&#039;m thinking bad, bad things.

Ps2 think I know the video. Brooks &#038; his guyliner?]]></description>
