		<description><![CDATA[I am SOOO happy for you, Chuck!!!! That is incredible and what a perfect game to attend! I can&#039;t imagine how that would feel...I&#039;m not sure I would be conscious at a Pens SCF in Pittsburgh. I&#039;m not even from Pittsburgh, but I would probably die. Columbus is technically my &quot;home team,&quot; but let&#039;s be realistic about this. However, to be fair, I would also be unconscious in Rick Nash&#039;s arms. Does that count as the closest I could come to a Columbus SCF?

Very well-written, by the way. :)]]></description>
