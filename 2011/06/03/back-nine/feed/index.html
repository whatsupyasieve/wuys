		<description><![CDATA[My first reaction to this video?

&quot;DOES HE HAVE FROSTED TIPS?!?&quot;

Second reaction, in response to &quot;All jokes aside...&quot;

&quot;Oh honey... that was a joke?&quot;

Third and overall reaction.

&quot;Swoons, why are you so cute? I need to have your babies.&quot;

Yup - my fangirl is definitely out of control.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll be driving the cart ladies - I&#039;m excellent when chasing down hotties! A road trip is totally happening - spectator tickets for JT&#039;s golf week are only $30 - plus folks from the &#039;Peg clear out of the city once it&#039;s infiltrated with mosquitos, so it&#039;ll be dead. :)

Side note - you&#039;re so right: Tazer for sure had the Jets sheets and other paraphernalia. I&#039;m also betting on pajamas - adorable! Don&#039;t you also love the quotes in the YouTube video? Toews &quot;pumped&quot; about &quot;Jets.&quot;

Happy to find this video - I&#039;ll do what I can do fill the void of the off-season with as many photos and videos that I can stalk down!]]></description>
