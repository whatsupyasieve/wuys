		<description><![CDATA[I told Jeff that he should go with Suit #1. #2 is too guido and #3 looks like he stole it from his dad&#039;s closet to wear to his cousin&#039;s wedding.

Oh and Jeffy - make sure you save me a dance at Pants&#039; wedding!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Jeff, we&#039;re slightly disappointed you didn&#039;t just ask us to pick the suit, but then again Dawn would probably have put you in Ovi-wear, Chuck and I probably would have gone with a black-and-gold theme and Pants, well Pants told you to call Greener and he does have questionable taste in t-shirts, let&#039;s face it!

But I promise to knot your tie in a proper Windsor (full not half) and you can hang it on a hook &#038; loosen it. Save you all the frustration of trying to remember the rabbit thing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awwww, Intern Skinner - you make us proud! I hope you&#039;re back next year to get the WUYS girls Mexi -Colas and figure skating lessons. My vote over at Seventeen mag was the black suit and black tie - keep it classy, Skinner. Especially in Vegas with guys like Ovi (which T-shirt will he wear to the Awards) and Greener (maybe unbuttoning his shirt even more than last year) - you&#039;ll be the sexiest rookie there!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I vote for the third suit - the one on the right.  The one on the left looks like it&#039;s funeral time.  The one in the middle looks like you should be doing the electric slide while eating Pop Rocks.  What?  Oh, don&#039;t make me explain that one.

Have fun Jeff!  And remember, your curfew is midnight and I need the keys back to my jeep.

Pants - happy wedding!  Congrats!]]></description>
