		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, we know.  The NHL set up their media day at BU too, because BU is awesome.  We swear this flag hangs mostly so we have something to point to when chanting &quot;BC Sucks&quot; even when they&#039;re not playing.  Like the Yankees flag at Fenway. ;)  BC&#039;s too far outside the city to use their gym anyway.

Now Scheider&#039;s in for Luongo...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s probably a good thing I&#039;m still across the Atlantic. Neither Burrows, Rome nor, let&#039;s face it, Savvy (dream guy - Chuck &#038; I have excellent taste &#038; the Professor is 10 years younger than me :() would be safe.

I can untie knots. Handcuffs &#038; a restraining order more helpful with me lol.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh we know!  I see those signs at every hockey game I go to at BU.

We were merely commented on the fact that both a Canuck AND Boston College were in the same photo.  Hated by proximity. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[LADIES! Check out your sources before hating! The Cancuks are ACTUALLY at BU Case Gym for workouts, NOT BC (that&#039;s the HE banner that hangs around all of the BU arenas/gyms). boston.com article: http://www.boston.com/sports/hockey/bruins/articles/2011/06/08/canucks_teammates_defend_rome/

Don&#039;t agree with the headline or anything they say, just posting b/c I got the article through my  BU google alert :)]]></description>
