You&#039;re shoveling snot rockets off the ice .... at least make it seem glamerous!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know!  When I heard &quot;Ice Crew&quot; I assumed it was a bunch of guys in coveralls prepping the ice.

		<description><![CDATA[They would not let me with in 100 miles of letang. And seriously, why can&#039;t they come up with better names. ICE CREW ... seriously? why not Ice princesses or ice empresses after the emperor penguins. I mean really. how hard is this? they could even have a fan contest where we could name them and take the burden off of them. but ice crew? ugh!]]></description>
