		<description><![CDATA[1) How did I miss this?

2) Are you trying to replace Mike Green on TV?  Do you think you can get away with that crap around here?  He needs more fancy cars and TVs in the living room fireplace, obvs.  So back off.]]></description>

I watched the interviews last night and no, he&#039;s not the coldest puck in the fridge but i think he is maturing and for that, I&#039;ll add him to my list of peeps to watch.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That first pic, while hot, is cracking me up.  Like how does a photo shoot like that go down?

&quot;Ok, Lapierre, we&#039;re going to rub some dirt on you now... ok, that looks pretty good.  Now stand there and make it look like you just got done digging a big hole.  No, not like that.  Maybe try putting your one leg up on something, and stare off into space, like all of the hard work you just did put you in to a contemplative mood.  There you go - that&#039;s it!  Totally authentic.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know, on one hand he seems like he&#039;d be fun in the French-Canadian flirty way. And he&#039;s built, for sure. But on the other hand, there&#039;s a Canucks video where he was unable to name all ten provinces.

Ah, what the hell, as that song goes, &quot;I like them big and stupid.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OK, dawn. This has GOT TO STOP. Enough with the Vancouver post. Srsly. I cannot agree with this Foxy Friday - there couldn&#039;t have been a worse Canuck to score that goal. I groaned extensively when my husband told me who scored.

I&#039;ll just go enjoy my favourite Foxy Friday - Jonathan Toews. http://whatsupyasieve.wordpress.com/2010/10/08/foxy-friday-jonathan-toews/

Ahhhh. Much better.]]></description>
