This MADE my day. Just the knowledge that Sid sounds like he&#039;s making progress is amazing. And even better?? He&#039;s coming home to Canada!!

Pants, I forgot to mention that I&#039;m going to Nova Scotia/PEI in August! We&#039;re staying in Halifax for two days, and as part of our travels, will be driving through Cole Harbour! Wheeeee! My poor husband. Operation Summer Stalking now includes Mike Green AND Crosby!]]></description>
