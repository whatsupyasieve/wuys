		<description><![CDATA[Tornado watch?! Boston?! You&#039;re kidding me, right?! As for the biting - that&#039;s another player on my sh*t list. Gonna have to make a special trip for you, Burrows, after I stop by Giroux&#039;s house in Philly.

Pants said it on Twitter. NO-ONE is allowed to bite the Professor!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, that was a fantastic game with a terrible outcome. Not to mention that TORRES scored the goal. I hate that man so much.

Have you seen his photo? FOR CHRIST&#039;S SAKE. THIS WAS THE BEST PHOTO THEY HAD OF HIM?
