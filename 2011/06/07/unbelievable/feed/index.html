		<description><![CDATA[That per-game breakdown is what suckered us (4 of us) into tickets 5 seasons ago...~$600 for a seasons-worth of MG52 and Ovie love? SIGN ME UP. The view from the 400 levels ain&#039;t that bad...especially when you can peer into the press box and see away scratches (HELLO MATT GILROY) and Caps players on the mend. We were collectively considering starting a business so we could apply for tickets on the 200 level but couldn&#039;t part with our 400-level family.

I&#039;m going tonight to the select-a-seat event to see what is available. I just couldn&#039;t stay away from the Verizon center any longer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Season tix in the 400s are $1400. That’s under $35/game, which is really quite good if you can go to every game. Or be bothered to sell your tickets. But Gator and I have decided instead to buy really good seats for just the games we want – Pens, Bolts, Hawks, Wings. That way when Chuck, Dawn or anyone else visits, we can all sit together!

Sidney is relieved. He was really worried about me there for a minute.]]></description>
