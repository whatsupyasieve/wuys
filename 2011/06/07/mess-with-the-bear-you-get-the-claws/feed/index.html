		<description><![CDATA[Owing to time difference, I can&#039;t watch the games live. But the 8-1 win is AWESOME!!! And A Burrows got an unsportsmanlike conduct, slashing and a game misconduct. Perhaps someone was listening to all the rage on the blogs after his appalling behaviour.

I think we do best when we come out as underdogs.  And it teaches the naysayers that there was no way this was going to be a four game clean sweep for the Canucks.

We also play best when we&#039;re totally PISSED. Come on guys! You can do it and I&#039;m sure Looch is just as grateful as me for the birthday wins!]]></description>
