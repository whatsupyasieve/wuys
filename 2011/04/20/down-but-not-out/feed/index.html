		<description><![CDATA[My favourite part of this post? The grandmother&#039;s reaction. Absolutely fabulous. You know she didn&#039;t even want to GO to this game, and then sat front row at one of the most exciting games of the playoffs. Seriously, I still have this on my PVR - and it&#039;s not getting deleted anytime soon.

Is it insane that I now find Duncan Keith sexy after he not only scored a great goal, but retaliated against the Canucks after the hit on Seabrook? Delicious.

Also - as a Canadian only able to watch the games on CBC, I&#039;m SO jealous of your Versus coverage. While they were correctly rewarding Tazer with accolades following his awesome game, CBC kept talking about how both Toews and Kaner were having &quot;disappointing games.&quot; WTF? Plus, you know the CBC announcers are wearing Vancouver jerseys under their dress shirts. Pathetic.

Fingers crossed for game 5.]]></description>
