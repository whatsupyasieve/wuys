		<description><![CDATA[Quite - and doesn&#039;t it make you want to snuggle in a darkened room, on a king size bed with him? During migraines, obviously lol. Wish I was in the US - I only get offered shots if they get worse...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yet another migraine sufferer here.  I take Relpax myself, less side effects than Imitrex/sumatriptan.  I understand how much it sucks, I have way too many migraines and end up wasting so many days not feeling well.  At least I can watch the Caps while laid up suffering.

Ovie is so amusing and funny.  He&#039;s like a little child in the body of an adult.  I don&#039;t really get how people can hate him, he&#039;s just having fun in life.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I get migraine too, not to get too personal, but have you checked out any outside factors? Mine come around when it&#039;s low barometric pressure outside, high pollen count and That time of the month. I went to the ER because my left side went numb, I couldnt walk because  the floor looked bubbled up, and I couldn&#039;t read my computer screen. Long story short after seeing my neorologist, she prescribed Maxalt-MLT, which is a meltaway med to take as soon as you feel it coming. I hope it gets better, migraines suck.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[lumbar puncture? holy shit! they never asked me for that! I only had the MRI which came back normal and had me asking really? my family thinks I&#039;m not! now I have scientific proof! When I get the &#039;shot&#039; - Mr.Cherrie finds me highly entertaining when that happens because he has to drive me home and I can&#039;t drink alochol EVER so this is only time to laugh at me and the things I say like, &quot;Oh I could totaly be driving now!&quot; as I walk into the car door.

Anyway, thanks for the sympathy. Still not gone .. been a week and 1/2 so thinking a shot is in order if only to keep my husband from burying me in the backyard! ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re right: Ovi is all yours, but can I snuggle with Brooks if he and Greener are over with them watching 13 going on 30?

Sympathy on the migraine: my last one landed me in hospital having tests (which given a lumbar puncture was involved was worse than the migraine and they&#039;re worse than Hades), so I do feel your pain. Sensing you hugs, virtual Midol, Aspirin, Codeine and my special migraine meds xx]]></description>
