		<description><![CDATA[I watched that video roughly 20 times last night. I miss them more than I miss my extended family. I love that Geno isn&#039;t dressed up. Sid, always the face of the franchise.

...and yes, can Flower please score?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually, like, hell yeah to all of that - but secretly you want Sid the Kid to do a Savvy, come back to play, score the winner in OT (like my hurt hero) cos that would be, like, AWESOME. Actually, I&#039;d kinda like Savvy to do that right about now as well, my adoration of The Professor notwithstanding!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OK seriously...that video is golden. I&#039;m keeping that open at work and watching whenever there&#039;s no one else around! Crosby is such a fox - and love the suit. How sad is it that I get all flushed watching him hi-five his teammates in a video. Can&#039;t imagine the freak show I&#039;ll be when he returns to the ice!! And really, Geno? Can you at least TRY to dress like a grownup? Are sweats necessary 100% of the time? You&#039;re not even playing.]]></description>
