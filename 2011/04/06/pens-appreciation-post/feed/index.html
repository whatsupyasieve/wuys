		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think any mugging would happen. Did you see how afraid most of those fans were who received the jerseys? I think the fans would be respectful if they went up in the stands. We are also talking hockey players here. I think Matt Cooke can take care of himself! HA and MAX TALBOT would just kiss them to death or die trying! Besides, it is &#039;fan appreciation&#039; and really, the ones way up there rarely ever get any props. It would be like Oprah&#039;s FAVORITE THINGS episode!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Multiple things to say:

1. I completely agree with Dawn. I&#039;m usually that poor college kid in the nosebleeds, screaming like a maniac and cussing out those texting in the second row. However, you&#039;re right. If Jordan Staal came up to the nosebleeds to give me a shirt, I would tackle him.

2. Ben Lovejoy&#039;s face of complete excitement killed me. His smile is contagious.

3. Geno&#039;s H belt is a Hermes belt. Haha...

4. Sid. Sid. Sid. Sid. Sid. My eyes were watering while watching this. If I had been chosen to receive his jersey, I would have whispered &quot;I miss you&quot; in his ear...and he probably would have notified security. Rightfully so.

5. How much better would this be if they DIDN&#039;T have shirts on underneath? I would have to be scraped from the floor following the game.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OK - you didn&#039;t mention the mean girls group staring lazerbeams of hate at the woman who got MAX TALBOT&#039;s jersey! HAHAHAHAH! seriously! WOW! And really? some of the guys should have manned up and went higher up in the stands to give out shirts than girly tosses to people who have money for $200+ seats. The real fans are the ones up in the nose bleeds and would DIE for those shirts. how much would that make their LIVES if even one of the players took their skates off and did that? Just sayin&#039;]]></description>
