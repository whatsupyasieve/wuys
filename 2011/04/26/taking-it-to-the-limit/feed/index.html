		<description><![CDATA[Brittany - I feel where you&#039;re coming from too - we&#039;re in the same position with the B&#039;s and I may have no hair left by tomorrow. Plus with the time difference...

As for demonic sacrifices, I wonder if the only way to go is human? In which case I offer up the useless moron of an exroommate (now living downstairs). This would amount to a useful contribution to society.

Sorry - I&#039;m feeling bitchy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your optimism gives me hope. I am terrified...and an eternal pessimist. My reaction last night was equal to most people&#039;s game 7 loss reaction. Haha...

My parents already offered to give me money so that I won&#039;t watch the game at home. It&#039;s THAT bad. I also wrote a terrifying blog post in which I offer to sacrifice my family&#039;s demonic pomeranian in order to help the Pens.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow. I remember when Staal was making that face during the game, and I thought I was going to pass out from pure fear of the all-consuming rage he was projecting.  He&#039;s going to be an awesome dad someday.  He can just make that face and his kids will do whatever he says.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ryan Malone IS a weird ginger - thanks for pointing that out! His beard is weird - and have you seen his tats? I totally screws with my mind - ginger + gangster tats? Bizarre.

I can&#039;t believe we&#039;re in a Game 7 situation with the Pens/Bolts. Unbelievable for them to blow that kind of a lead.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My heart... oh my heart during that game. All my screaming officially scared my dogs into another room to cower in the corner.

Ryan Malone... I&#039;d like to punch him right in his weird ginger face.]]></description>
