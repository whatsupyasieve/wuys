Remember - it only takes 1 goal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pants, I love you. WUYS is the only other group of people who truly understand what I&#039;m going through today:

- That I&#039;m counting down the hours until puck drop (currently 10.5 hours to go)
- That I&#039;m avoiding speaking to anyone who&#039;s cheering for Vancouver, for fear of getting arrested due to rage
- That I&#039;m bailing on dinner with friends to ensure I&#039;m able to watch Game 7
- That I&#039;m home from the gym in time to make dinner, to be ready to go for puck drop
- That I&#039;ve purchased the hard alcohol necessary to get through the game in advance, so I&#039;m ready to go for tonight
- That I truly believe the boys can get it done tonight - one goal, guys. One goal.]]></description>
