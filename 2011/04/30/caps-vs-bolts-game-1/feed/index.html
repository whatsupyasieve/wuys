		<description><![CDATA[!!!!!!!

The fangirl freeze is a silent killer of all happily-ever-after dreams! Take a xanex and be ready for game 5!

This is pretty fitting because I got a text this morning from my TB fan friend that says, &quot;Apparently last night I wouldn&#039;t shut up about about Steven Stamkos and I kept telling everyone that we were 5 years older than him but he is more successful! Finally my man friend told me to be quiet about it and I said, &quot;You&#039;re just jealous that I lust over 20 year old hockey players.&quot;

Shortly after, another text:

&quot;And then Crosby was on ESPN and I tried to convince everyone that he was in 98 degrees&quot;

Great way to start the morning!]]></description>
