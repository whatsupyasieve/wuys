		<description><![CDATA[Me too - I think Asham is often overlooked/underrated.  I think he&#039;s good at protecting the puck and navigating his way through neutral ice.  It was great to see him get a goal.

And there&#039;s always plenty of Free Candy in the playoffs!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was so happy to see Asham have a little moment. And Orpik, holy lord what a game he had! That&#039;s not to say the bolts didn&#039;t have  a great game too. Going into the third period I wasn&#039;t sure how either of them was ever going to score. I&#039;m glad the team&#039;s grandpa Kovy could shift the momentum in our favor though.]]></description>
