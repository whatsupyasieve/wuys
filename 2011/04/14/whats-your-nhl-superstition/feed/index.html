		<description><![CDATA[Sidney,I will admit, was adorable in embracing his OCD. Toews ... seriously. NEEDS A HOBBY that isn&#039;t HOCKEY! E. Staal ... shower away! I&#039;m sure several of our loyal readers would sign up for a car cash style service between periods too!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[SIDNEY!  He embraces his own crazy and I think that&#039;s awesome.  The PB&#038;J ritual on 24/7 made my inner 5-year old squee.

Also love King Henrik almost too embarrassed to finish his own sentence, though his superstition is harmless.  He can&#039;t stop being le cool for two seconds.

And Toews is lying - that boy has the crazy like nobody&#039;s business.  His superstition is probably not to tell anyone his superstition, in which case someone should have asked Kaner to tell.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I only drink canadian beer during the game, which makes the loud screaming at the TV all that much more fun. I always wear a shirt supporting my team, and in the pen&#039;s case I wore a white shirt Wednesday.

I can see it now, Tazer brushing Kane&#039;s mullet, telling him he&#039;s a pretty pony before the game. HA!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, my sweet God...cannot stop the E. Staal shower visual. Then, the extended discussion on the shower? Yes, please.

That seems like the logical Tazer response. Haha...]]></description>
