		<description><![CDATA[I love him. He&#039;s awesome and quite possibly one of the nicest guys I&#039;ve ever met. He shoulda been in goal at the Olympics. Seriously - I was waiting to meet him and these guys butted in and he was like - she&#039;s been waiting. And asked me where I was from. I made him smile. :D. If he doesn&#039;t get the Vezina, I hope he gets something else AND a fan award. Ladies - let&#039;s get on it!]]></description>
