		<description><![CDATA[Oh, I almost cried last night when the Hawks were sent home for the summer.  Did you see poor Tazer&#039;s face in the post-game interviews?  Now this?  The pain is too great.  My penguin boys have exited the building.

I&#039;m going to go drown myself in Hawaiian punch and rubbing alcohol.

No point in watching any more hockey now.]]></description>
