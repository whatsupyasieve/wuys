		<description><![CDATA[After Burrows scored the OT goal, I just laid on the floor and repeated the word &quot;No&quot; over and over until I was sleeping.

It may not be fair, but that SHG is exactly what I expected from Tazer. &#060;3 Further proof that he&#039;s perfect.

Holy Corey Crawford.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post, Pants.

Heartbreaker, for sure, but they have it a valiant effort.

And Captain Serious...he&#039;s seriously the real freakin&#039; deal.

I&#039;ll pick him for my team any day!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OK had to post one more time. This quote from Tazer totally makes me cry:

&quot;It doesn’t matter what you say,&quot; Hawks captain Jonathan Toews said. &quot;I&#039;m so disappointed. We battled so hard for each other. There wasn’t a doubt in my mind or any of our minds that the way we played the last three games, what we showed each other, what we showed everyone else out there ... that we weren’t going to win this game.&quot;

Tears, Toews, tears.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t even believe this happened. It was like the worst movie I&#039;ve ever seen - when that puck went in during overtime, and the blue jerseys flooded the ice, all I could think was, &quot;That&#039;s the wrong colour of jerseys - it should be the white jersey piling up together.&quot;

I was SO HAPPY that JT got his playoffs goal right when we needed it most. I&#039;m with you - anyone that questions his talent, skill and position as the team&#039;s leader is a fool. Prime example is how he handled himself after the game. The post-game interviews nearly broke my heart, but JT again had heart and poise. While Henrik Sedin, the Canucks&#039; &quot;captain&quot; made comments like, &quot;They didn&#039;t deserve to be in Game 7,&quot; Tazer stood tall and said, &quot;I&#039;m not going to be a sore loser and you have to respect what they did out there.&quot; Leader, through and through.

They battled longer and harder than anyone expected them to, and that was the best playoffs series I&#039;ve ever seen. I only have two hopes coming out of last night&#039;s game:

1. That the Hawks will use the summer to rest, regroup and refocus - and come back an even better team than 2009-2010.

2. That someone else takes out the Canucks and again destroys their Cup dreams.]]></description>
