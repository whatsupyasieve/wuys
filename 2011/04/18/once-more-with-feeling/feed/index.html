		<description><![CDATA[Contrary to what anyone thinks, I don&#039;t like to see sad panda faces anywhere except on Sean Avery&#039;s face where I wish to god some would give him two black eyes! Other than that, I had hoped that Capt. Serious and his side kick Mullet Boy would have at least made the quarter finals interesting. I have mad respect for the dudes hockey ability. But as I&#039;ve said before, dude needs to get laid and relax - feel the force luke!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Youâ€™re close.  Youâ€™re so close youâ€™re RIGHT THERE.&quot;

typical. just like a man to get you right to the edge and then leave you hanging. unsatisfied.

i was excited those first two periods, thinking that THIS was the Hawks that i expected to see in the post season so far. but then the 3rd period came and they looked like they had those first two games-- messy and frustrated.

::sigh::

love the blog ladies (and man). just recently found you guys and i am so glad i did. ;)]]></description>
