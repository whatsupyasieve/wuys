		<description><![CDATA[Ughh...I just can&#039;t root for the Caps. Even if Brooks Laich was on his knees, begging me, and offering me red velvet ice cream and Dr. Pepper, I would still say no.

I&#039;m not a huge fan of the Rangers, either. BUT, they do have a ginger Staal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I hope the Caps win, because I am a heathen who is cheating on her real team.   Plus I really hate the Rangers.  And how can you cheer against a team that looks like this when they score?&quot;

Ditto. Dawn - don&#039;t you DARE say a word!]]></description>
