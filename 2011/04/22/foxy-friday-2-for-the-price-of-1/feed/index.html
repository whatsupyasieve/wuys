		<description><![CDATA[He has been sort of *merp* since coming over from the Habs so I don&#039;t people notice because he isn&#039;t scoring a ton and getting highlight reel goals.

He is foxy to be sure.  Now if he can also start being goal-y then we&#039;re golden.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[People are only just NOW discovering Mike&#039;s foxiness?! He almost distracted me from the Professor last year. ALMOST. (this could have something to do with the fact he&#039;s only 5 years younger than me, like my ex, so I don&#039;t feel quite so, er, cougarish)

He also ROCKED the goal scoring LAST year in the playoffs. Shiny. He&#039;s obviously got a special scoring stick he saves for ONLY the playoffs. ;)

I &#060;3 him too, but being a Bruin, almost always a given.

Except Horton&#039;s beard. *shudders*]]></description>
