		<description><![CDATA[AND don&#039;t forget BU alum Mr. Poti in the background. Looks at though he is graying a bit at the temples. My ovaries cannot handle all this cuteness.

I may have tweeted at mG52 and his bud Paul (featured in this video http://www.nbcwashington.com/on-air/shows/wrc/lunch-with-lindsay/Caps__Green_Focuses_on_Taking_Better_Care_of_Himself_Washington_DC-112571739.html) that they should come out to DC instead of the fundraiser in Arlington on Friday night.  I didn&#039;t get a response but one day I will. And then, typical chelski, will run away the minute I see him.

I am in full support of these glasses, I was honestly concerned they would be the black ray ban-ish glasses favorites of hipsters all over the place. Whoever sold him those glasses, over anything else, deserves a drink or seven from all of us MG52 fans!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Killing me ded, Mr. Green.

Puppies??? Is he serious?  He can&#039;t be.  Can he?  We need to be friends with him ASAP.

When are you going to start inviting him to every movie screening in the DC Area?]]></description>
