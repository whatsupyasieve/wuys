		<description><![CDATA[Glad to know that I&#039;m not the only one that depressed over here... Pants, maybe you should get Chuck to make some more Tazer Cats for good luck, and even though we don&#039;t generally use prayer circles for injuries/health issues, maybe make this exception because the Hawks really need to make the playoffs. They need. To make it. Love the Joey picture, by the way. And Joey will definitely not be amused if his dad doesn&#039;t make the playoffs. Oh, and on the note of junior reporters, the Pens have their own little journalist: http://video.penguins.nhl.com/videocenter/console?id=105577... Not as cute as Joey, but still. :)]]></description>
