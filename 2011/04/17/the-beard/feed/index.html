Not so sure about TIMMAY&#039;s porn &#039;stache, though...

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s why I disqualified many. But let&#039;s hope max just let&#039;s it grow rather than do any manscaping because the fu-man-chu he was not rocking - SUCKED. I can&#039;t wait to see Mike Green&#039;s if they stay in the play-offs because it may over take his face and Ovi&#039;s Gillette endoresment has screwed him but it looks like he is growing a GO-TEAM! hahahahaha!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I bet Max is trying out a new idea; different stage of beard for each round. Like he&#039;s said in the past; after two weeks in the wild with the male members of his family, they look, well, HAIRY. And yet even MAX TALBOT looks good like that.

Does Fidget&#039;s assist make this week&#039;s Mikey Monday Pants?! What can I say?! You and Dawn have thoroughly corrupted me. Well, between Mr Blue-Blue Eyes, Fidget and the fact they&#039;re playing the NYR, it was no contest really!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You beat me to Shea Weber, Dawn.  I was cracking myself up last night with a post idea and you&#039;ll have to hope the Preds make round 2 so I can post it!

That is the least beard Max has had all season.  Maybe his challenge is to NOT grow one.  It&#039;ll be tougher for Max to keep it off than most of these guys to put it on. ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bergy ALWAYS looks sexy. He almost always has stubble and it makes me go weak at the knees. ESP in RL. Oh man it&#039;s embarrassing. But I am NOT like Horton&#039;s. It&#039;s bad, ESP combined with his charity brush cut. I know it&#039;s for a good cause, but he looks like an extra from Planet of the Apes and I&#039;m not talking human. Any updates on MAX TALBOT&#039;s Saskwatch status btw?! Because that man does BEARD. Can I just have all the Quebequois on my team please?!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Some of my Wings can grow pretty damn impressive beards: Bertuzzi, Zetterberg, Cleary, Franzen. Even our little babies Helm and Abdelkader have some facial hair going this year.

I have to say, I&#039;m REALLY liking Green&#039;s scruffy face. A LOT. Too bad my boy John Carlson has way too much of a baby face to grow a playoff beard :)

Regarding Dubinsky&#039;s &#039;stache... I couldn&#039;t stop laughing every time he was on camera today. He looks ridiculous, and honestly his mustache looks fake, like it was drawn on with a Sharpie haha]]></description>

Every time I saw him I was like, &quot;WTF?&quot; and he is like two years old ...I had to keep checking to make sure it was the same dude! It&#039;s an amazing feat! Watch to find out it&#039;s fake! HA!]]></description>
