		<description><![CDATA[Foxy Friday is some kind of magic pill.  Arnott just scored to put the Caps up 2-0.  He&#039;s gotta be the 10th Foxy Friday to have a fantastic game the minute we post about him.  That&#039;s in, next season we&#039;re auctioning this category off to the teams.  Pay us in tickets, beer, locker room visits...]]></description>
