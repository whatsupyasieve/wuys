		<description><![CDATA[That game was crazypants. Actually, the whole series has been crazy. It starts with Vancouver wrecking shit, and then all of a sudden Dunc is avenging his husband, Dave Bolland is one bad bitch, and who the f is this Ben Smith kid?

Good thing Luongo has a big deal. He&#039;s going to need a lot of counselling for his Hawks induced PTSD after this one.]]></description>

Tuesday will be too intense for words.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pants, I&#039;m torn.  I want to cheer for the Hawks but I can&#039;t bring myself to cheer for Ben Smith.

He went to Boston College.

		<description><![CDATA[Best. Game. Ever. I watched this game at my in-laws and warned them of the excessive amounts of profanity, deep sighs and screaming that would ensue. Even an advance warning wasn&#039;t enough to take the shock away.

What an incredible effort by both team - down to the wire I was convinced Vancouver would take the series, and THRILLED when Smithy put the puck in the back of the net. I&#039;ve been watching the highlights for 12 hours and STILL can&#039;t get enough. Tomorrow&#039;s going to be epic - I don&#039;t know what kind of anxiety meds I&#039;ll need to get through the day. Canada is closed.]]></description>
