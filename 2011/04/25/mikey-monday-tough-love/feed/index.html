		<description><![CDATA[If Animal takes up residence again, I&#039;m calling in Pest Control. Or the Browncoats (did ya like that?!)

That was hilarious! Do you think Nicky &#038; Mikey have one of those 3-armed snuggly things to cuddle in? And who has control of the remote? I think we should be told.

But if Nicky goes all Ho-like I&#039;ll share your sandwich with you Mike! :)]]></description>
