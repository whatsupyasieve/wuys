		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve still got my B&#039;s for now and hoping the Caps whoop some serious a** against Tampa Bay! I cannot decide for my West Coast love! I mean there&#039;s Holy Joe Thornton, but there&#039;s also Shea Weber&#039;s beard. Thank GOD I don&#039;t have to decide yet!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[what happens in the play-offs when you team is out, stays in the play-offs when your team is out! your secret it safe and no one needs to know because you did it the privacy of your own home! :) And of course you can submit your suggestions here if you want more of something. :) And the best thing is, you can have as much or as little as you want! You can test the waters, switch, mix it up, what ever! It&#039;s not cheating because come October, you have your own men back! It&#039;s quite nice. Trust me, I KNOW!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is awesome advice.  So many choices.  It feels kind of like cheating.  Promise you won&#039;t tell Kris.

I might have to adopt Martin St. Louis.  He impressed the hell out of me in this series.  I wouldn&#039;t make out with him in the produce aisle, mind you, but I&#039;m a little bit afraid of him and I&#039;m kind of intrigued.

And Nicklas Backstrom, because I&#039;ve been to Sweden and it is awesome and I have a soft spot for Swedes.  I wouldn&#039;t admit to liking a Caps player on the streets here in Pittsburgh but I think my secret is safe here on the internet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I seriously fell apart last year when the Caps lost. Adn that was like the highest high to the lowest of lows sister! Ask Mr. Cherrie. I was NOT FUN.I honestly know what everyone feels like but then I picked Tanger (NOT THE PENS!) and went with it and it made me feel so much better. :) It really worked.
Take you time and find someone YOU feel good about. And like I said, it doesn&#039;t have to be a team. It wasn&#039;t for me. It was some hot eye candy. ;) It does wonders for your hockey soul.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is incredibly put! I sat at work today thinking over last night&#039;s loss and every time I wanted to cry. I said to myself, who&#039;s left REALLY?! Nobody I care about, ppsshhh! But no, I must soldier on. I promised my Bolts fan friend that I&#039;d rally behind the Bolts if they beat then pens but... well that&#039;s not happening. I&#039;m still bitter. Dawn, I hope there&#039;s room for all of the love in D.C because I have a lot of love to give!]]></description>
