		<description><![CDATA[Pants - I feel for you.  I do.  My heart sank when I saw the result.

If anyone wants to turn to the dark side now, can I recommend the Boston Bruins? Lots of French Canadian HAWTNESS to revel in.

Plus we&#039;re playing the Flyers.  IN the second round. AGAIN.  I think we might need all the prayers we can get.  Unless, that is, the boys want revenge and go out to kill those Philly men.

And I will be rooting for the Caps as well. Dawn - don&#039;t you DARE say anything! It&#039;s like the t-shirt from Back to Beantown says - NO WAY TAMPA BAY! You put out the Pens, grrrr.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m completely out of options for who to root for now that the Pens are out. I&#039;m contemplating the dark side of rooting for Ovi and Sasha, honestly.

I&#039;m going to go wallow in Kris Letang posts now. Maybe his shiny flowing locks will make me feel better.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[At least they went out fighting.  They played hard last night.  They did everything they could have possibly done and it&#039;s a miracle for Tampa that none of our shots went in.  So at least it wasn&#039;t an embarrassing lost.  Imagine if game 6 would have been the last game.  Vomit.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Way back on 10/6, I called upon the universal to deliver me a Pens/Hawks Cup final.  Now we can just have a Pens/Hawks golf tournament and I&#039;ll drive the beer cart.

		<description><![CDATA[You said it best, Pants - the worst sports 24 hours of my life actually happened. Truth be told, I&#039;m still more upset about the Hawks. I love the Pens, and they rallied SO MUCH, but just couldn&#039;t get it done. And who could blame them? Really, missing that much arsenal ... it&#039;s tough.

Tomorrow is Tazer&#039;s birthday, and I swear, if I see another post-game interview of him all sad and trying to be a good leader, I will never stop crying. What an awful week.

That said, I think these early losses will be great for both teams. They&#039;ll regroup, likely make some roster changes (imminent for the Hawks who need to add some depth and size) and come back stronger than ever. My dream 2012 Stanley Cup Finals matchup? Hawks vs. Pens. Laugh all you want, but I&#039;m holding fast to the dream.]]></description>
