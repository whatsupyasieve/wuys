		<description><![CDATA[I cannot agree with this plan to become Sedinbots. Vancouver is EVIL! I have a Hockey Hottie Pool and I can&#039;t even have Kesler or Bieksa in my pool because it&#039;s like cheering for Satan. The Western Canada rivalry is STRONG.

That said, I&#039;m SO nervous about tonight. I&#039;m trying to console myself with the fact that IF JT loses tonight, we&#039;ll still have the Pens - my #1 team. But the thought of Tayzer losing (and we all know how bad he loses) will make me cry. There may be tears tonight - BUT I&#039;m holding out hope that the sexiness of the Hawks will prevail!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But first we have to take polyjuice potion and one of us has to turn into Carey Price and the other into Brian Gionta and TOTALLY blow the Bruins/Habs game tonight.

Hawks game is at 10pm EST so we&#039;ll have plenty of time to get back, re-juice and become Sedinbots.

Deal?]]></description>
