		<description><![CDATA[Paging Nurse (Nearly) Cassy AGAIN?! They&#039;ve gotta stop this injury nonsense. Attention seeking. I&#039;ll get to the ones that hurt them later. I WILL find them.

I don&#039;t like Trannysaurus Rex, but I&#039;m still working on nicknames. Thus far it&#039;s Grumpy Staal for Eric, Ginger Staal for Marc; I&#039;m gonna go with Tiny for Jared, as he&#039;s, well huge, more than the rest and stick with Baby Staal for Jordy. You like?&#039;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was a sociopath last night - screaming at the goals, the missed penalties, and Nealer&#039;s double OT win - I never knew so much profanity could come out of my mouth!

I even had to pick my husband up from work at the start of the third period - and LIVE STREAMED the radio broadcast on my iPhone - desperation, friends.

Saturday is going to be AMAAAAAAAAAAAZING.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love Neal&#039;s ginger scruff! I think the whole team should rub it for good luck, like a pet rock or something.

I was right there with Dupuis wanting to rip Brewer&#039;s head off while Max lay curled in the fetal position on the ice. Beware, Brewer! Duper will smother you in his beard that comes up to his eyeballs! You will get lost and never find your way out of the furry, French forest!

And umm... hey there Arron Asham, where the hell have you been all season?]]></description>
