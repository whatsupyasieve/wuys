		<description><![CDATA[Oh man - Brooks talks in his sleep and Steckel saying his new roommate is &quot;no Mike Green&quot; and the way Mike&#039;s face just lights up when he mentions Nicky B. LOL. Contract negotiations *snorts*

I didn&#039;t miss Nicky going on about him and Mike &quot;doing stuff&quot; either and barely able to look at the camera. I thought they might have been spooners before.  Now I am CONVINCED!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You should ask Mr. Pants what it&#039;s like to room with Brooks.  Because that is me.  He&#039;s out cold and I&#039;m color-coding my socks in the dark.  Well not really, but I&#039;m OCD about the blinds and the alarm and the noise... wow, I&#039;m probably really annoying, eh?

Mike should be more attentive to his roommate and make sure a camera never sees Nicky with that hair.  Is he wearing a ponytail?  I haven&#039;t seen a center part like that since the Backstreet Boys.  I just think about them drinking Diet Coke and crack up laughing.]]></description>
