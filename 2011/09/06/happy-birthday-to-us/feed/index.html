The best part of the gifts you&#039;re getting is that we all get to enjoy them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!

Us BU girls that live in the DC area should get together at some point this season...perhaps to celebrate midnight madness or something equally fun. BTW, Beanpot party at Crystal City Sports Pub. Be there!

Also, not sure if you gals are aware of pinterest but I have a board called &quot;hockey stuff&quot;  (http://pinterest.com/chelski52/hockey-stuff/) and it&#039;s mostly adorkable photos of MG52 and fun things related to the greatest sport EVER. Feel free to take from there for any Mikey Monday posts and I&#039;ll keep my eyes/ears our for anything that should be emailed over.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Happy birthday to you!

Your blog has got me through some of the more stressful moments (I don&#039;t know how many times I&#039;d pull up your blog when I&#039;d get tired of reading my nursing school notes studying for tests) of this last year, so thank you.

And here&#039;s to another year (and more) of blogging and doing what you guys do best!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good thing we weren&#039;t counting on our moms, because mine cannot a) use the internet or b) remember that halftime is not for hockey games.

Happy Birthday to us!  And thanks to all of you guys.  Especially Jess, for a gif of the palest werewolf ever.

Gator &#038; I celebrated by going to the White House today.  The tour does not include the spot where the Cup has been, but you can feel it.  Also there are no photos of Mike Green/Patrick Sharp/Michelle Obama kids&#039; hockey, because the place was designed by a man.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I already wished you guys a happy, happy birthday on twitter, but I figured I might as well do it here, too.
You guys are the reason for why I&#039;ve probably scared my roommate out of becoming a hockey fan. Well, maybe it was Tazer&#039;s quads or Tanger&#039;s everything... But that&#039;s neither here nor there.

More for us!
