		<description><![CDATA[I was happy to see him, happy that he isn&#039;t wasting away in come Canadian brain bunker somewhere, happy that progress has been made and we&#039;ll be seeing him out there again soon.

True story, right when the video feed started, my computer started buffering, freezing Sid in a full body profile shot. And I thought to myself, *sigh* at least his butt wasn&#039;t affected by the injury.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Definitely nice to see Sid again, and that smile.
I still want to deck the guy who proposed the possibility of retirement. I hope he got fired.
I think Sidney Crosby Pray Circle should still continue. When are meetings? :P
I hope Pants isn&#039;t hugging the toilet anymore.
Love you guys!]]></description>
