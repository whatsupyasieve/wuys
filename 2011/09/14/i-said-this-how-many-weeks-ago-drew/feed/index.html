Evidently this is not making him happy and we all know an unhappy drew is a crabby drew. So let&#039;s hope he doesn&#039;t drown himself in IN N OUT burgers, milkshakes and Raspberry filled donuts because then we&#039;d have to do an intervention! But I&#039;d still love him.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ack! I have only two more days to be right about DD signing before training camp!  But have you ever been in a relationship where the guy says &quot;I want you to do all the cooking, cleaning, income-earning, plus look hot and be constantly available sexually while I go out with my buddies every night and fool around on the side?&quot;
Of course NOT, because that&#039;s a little one-sided. And yet that&#039;s what Dean Lombardi apparently thinks is okay:

Bob McKenzie on Twitter today:
LAK adamant on 2 things with Doughty: deal needs to be at least 7 years long and cannot be more than $6.8M, same salary as Kopitar.

Deano, it&#039;s called a negotiation because both sides give a little. If neither side is completely happy that&#039;s what we call...marriage!]]></description>
