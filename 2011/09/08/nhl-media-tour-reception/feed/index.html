		<description><![CDATA[1) I have no problem with this number of buttons.  (Cue my Pussycat Dolls karaoke routine.)

2) Someone shorter than Patrick Kane FTW!  Oh hey, it&#039;s that gut from Entourage. Sir I do not know your name.

3) Kaner thought about buying the Mike Green shoes. I feel it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This media tour kills me. All I can think about was how my husband and I had planned to go to the US Open this year, then nixed it to go to Chicago in November. I COULD HAVE BEEN IN NYC THIS WEEK. And ditched my husband to pretend to be a Versace employee, and then snuck into the NHL Store event tomorrow. There would have been a lot of questions, but worth it.

PS - Chuck, all I can think when I watch that video is: ‚ÄúSteven Stamkos eats a mini-beef wellington! News at 11!‚Äù
PPS - JToews needs to button his shirt. One too open.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Given the overwhelming concentration of hockey hotness at this event, I will forgive you for overlooking the fact that Tazer seems to have forgotten some of his buttons. And has forgotten to eat. I still die. http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lr6v3gBHzC1qzw3v6o1_500.jpg

Also - WUYS needs to start paying Intern Jeff Skinner so he can get a new shirt. That one has made the rounds. Or maybe it&#039;s just that he is distraught because I broke up with him after prom and is too sad to go to the mall :-P]]></description>
