		<description><![CDATA[Hold the phone... 29?!? Only?!? He looks way older. Not in a bad way. In a handsomest-man-in-the-world-Jon-Hamm kind of way. So, not older... ageless? Like Patrick Sharp...

HE IS HANDSOME YEARS-OLD.

I don&#039;t have flash or sound on my work computer. And I am now just realizing why.... I would get nothing done. Nothing. Instead I will go home and get nothing done while I catch up on all the videos :P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love how they didn&#039;t include SIEVE to a GOALIE ... hahahahah! Now that would have made him really laugh. All we got was WHAT&#039;S UP? really? they couldn&#039;t include SEIVE? That&#039;s the whole point. Oh well. A good shampoo huh? it doesn&#039;t work for me. I still look like a qu-tip when I walk outside in the morning Henrik. Perhaps you need to come over and give me some pointers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I told my husband about WUYS&#039; Tweet this morning and he&#039;s like, &quot;Do you think Henrik will answer it?&quot;

AMAZING. This totally makes my day! That and the knowledge that JToews is in NYC for media tour appearances! http://lockerz.com/s/136886859

Is. It. October. Yet?]]></description>
