		<description><![CDATA[I wish and no offense to Ovi, he is THE BEST hockey player ever. But if I did look like that, and in the way-back machine, in my day, a few movie stars had been known to hit on me, I would be making out with Kris Letang while watching Ovi play! But thanks for the thought! LOL! ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For a millisecond there I was transfixed by the pic of him &#038; the blonde (you?!)

Then I shook myself, shuddered violently &#038; remembered the awesome power of stylists, makeup, tights over the lenses &#038; airbrushing skills.

All is well!]]></description>
