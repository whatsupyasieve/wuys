		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m going to go with you had exactly the same reaction I had when I met the Professor: EPIC FAIL.

Am I right?!

PS Hey Chuck! Hope you enjoyed my homeland! Guess what? We&#039;re now having a mini heatwave. High 70s. Lol.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well if you look anything like I did when I met Sid (the day after they won the Cup, I might add!), you&#039;d be a red-faced, gaspy, hyper-ventilating, shaky, blubbering hot mess. Yeah, it wasn&#039;t pretty. (Still, he greeted me and happily gave me his autograph. True love doesn&#039;t care about composure!) So if you meet Stammer one fine day, I wish you the words you need to profess your love of his adorableness and his lucious blonde locks to him, regardless of how loud you are girly-squealing on the inside. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That Tumblr post makes my life.
Also, I&#039;m going to find a way to sneak into Steven&#039;s hotel room (wait, don&#039;t let your perverted minds run away on you) to CUT HIS HAIR. It has to end.
Finally, I&#039;ll sneak you into Canada. I&#039;ll doctor some passports to make it happen for WUYS.]]></description>
