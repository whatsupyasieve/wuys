		<description><![CDATA[*clears throat*

It&#039;s okay I understand
This ain&#039;t no never-never land!
I hope that when this issue&#039;s gone
I&#039;ll see you when your clothes are on

Take you car, Yes we will
We&#039;ll take your car and drive it
We&#039;ll take it to a motel room
And take &#039;em off in private

A part of me has just been ripped
The pages from my mind are stripped
Oh no, I can&#039;t deny it
Oh yea, I guess I gotta buy it!

....and I&#039;m dead.

His sexxxiness in pic #2 is just so...effortless.  *le sigh*]]></description>
