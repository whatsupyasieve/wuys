		<description><![CDATA[HOLEEE SCHNIKES!!! I was previously just a Pens fan by association and friend loyalty, but now, I think I have to love them on my own. Good thing that they are in the Eastern conference so my loyalties to my lovely Blackhawks will not be tested until the Stanley Cup final that TSN is predicting. (Could you imagine a Hawks/Pens final?! NO ONE WOULD BE LEFT ALIVE.)

IS IT OCTOBER 6TH YET?! (That&#039;s right, I got me some tickets to the Canucks/Pens home opener! On a related note, would anyone like to buy a kidney?)]]></description>
