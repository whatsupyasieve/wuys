		<description><![CDATA[Ummmmm, excuse me? The NHLPA Player Tracker? Thank you for the early Christmas present Pants. Good God - now I&#039;m REALLY not going to get any work done.

Also - the Pens have a great app for download (you should know I could barely type this because my brain was busy having an explosion thanks to this app. If I get fired can I get a job doing filing for WUYS?).]]></description>
