		<description><![CDATA[Not enough words for the hilarity of this post! I don&#039;t know where you guys come up with this stuff, but keep it coming!!

Also, I have an appointment with Dr. Toews on 10/15. He&#039;s usually booked, so I&#039;ve literally had my tickets, I MEAN appointment for months!! ;)

PS This is the 2nd time today I&#039;ve heard about this Hockey Syrup, I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s worth giving it a look?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Haha - I&#039;m assuming you&#039;ve included me in your &quot;we&quot; because, no jokes, I literally priced out how much it would cost to fly from Vancouver to DC to see that game and... it was not prohibitive.

Two things:
1) I think Gator must now be added to my list of make-believe best friends.
2) Hockey Syrup may be the greatest thing ever and usually when I say I cried, it&#039;s an exaggeration to convey my inner fangil turmoil, but I had actual tears of laughter streaming down my face. &quot;How f*cking weird are commas?!&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gator: &quot;Who is that one?  The crazy one?  He&#039;s hot.  Is he over 21?&quot;

Pants: &quot;Yes.  He&#039;ll be at our Caps game Sunday.&quot;

Gator: &quot;Alllllllllright.  We&#039;re getting pregnant Sunday.&quot;]]></description>

PS Tazer I believe you&#039;re a doctor.]]></description>
