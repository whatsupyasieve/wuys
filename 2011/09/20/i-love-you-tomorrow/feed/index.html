		<description><![CDATA[Can I just say aww to JToews and RAWR to Sid&#039;s big, smiley face?! Plus Baby Staal on a line with Nealmobile?! Ladies everywhere will faint when that line scores! [no pun intended].

I&#039;ve missed hockey. Today I met a Slovakian doctor who just about collapsed in shock when I mentioned I&#039;d heard of Zdeno Chara. And met him. And then nearly died laughing when I told him the story of trying to wish the Big Guy a happy birthday in Slovakian [epic FAIL].

How long to hockey time again!? I&#039;m glad in Bruins wear &#038; sleeping in my Savvy shirt but mornings like it. EVER.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[TODAY, I love you! The Blackhawks are in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan - aka the breadbasket of Canada - to take on the Oilers. SQUEEEEEE! I&#039;m so desperate to watch I&#039;m using an IP blocker so I can actually stream the game.

Even more adorkable, JToews is playing with his baby brother David. Can I get a collective &quot;Awwwwww?&quot; Jon was interviewed yesterday about how David is messier than him, and he has to sometimes &quot;Get on his case.&quot; Heart explosion.

You can watch the video here - including Jon sass some reporter who drops his recorder. Captain Serios, I love you: http://video.blackhawks.nhl.com/videocenter/console?catid=690&#038;id=123733]]></description>
