		<description><![CDATA[I took figure skating lessons during the lockout, and made the mistake of asking my teacher how to improve my ankle strength (My wobbly ankles were making me drift to the left on my backward one-footed glides.  So tragic.)  Yeah, he showed me how to do lunges on skates.  I laughed and realized he was serious.  I did a few and thought, well, thankfully I didn&#039;t need really strong ankles.  He showed me a few other exercises, which I don&#039;t remember.  Clearly I needed Brooks demonstrated them for me, then I would have remembered them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I made the mistake of watching this video, in full-screen HD, when my computer was hooked up to my giant TV. I don&#039;t think I made it all the way to the end. I was blushing so hard.  Seriously though, what is the REAL reason that all these workout videos exist? Do men really watch other men work out for work out inspiration? This is a serious question. Because it seems to me that these videos only exist to cause FANGIRL DEATHSPLOSIONS. Especially at 4:50... that camera angle is not an accident.

Now... where is the 6 minute-long HD Toews workout video? Oh, that&#039;s right, it doesn&#039;t exist because NO ONE WOULD BE LEFT ALIVE.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad my being nocturnal and a Tumblr junkie finally made someone other than myself happy.

I think, next to the start of the season, that late-summer training is the best time of year for the appreciative female hockey fan.

Oh, pretty sure Brooks&#039; one-legged squats and amazing ab strength obliterated my ovaries for good]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good lord. I can&#039;t resist a man in Under Armour gear. Or maybe just Brooks.

My vote for the league&#039;s best squatter is still Tazer. He&#039;s in a league all of his own - literally, with his own WUYS category.

This terrible off-season is only made possible by the excessive amount of workout videos they&#039;ve released. Thank you Deb and thank you sweet baby Jesus.]]></description>
