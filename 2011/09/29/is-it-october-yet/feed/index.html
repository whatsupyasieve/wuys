		<description><![CDATA[Goin&#039; buy that ESPN mag ASAP, run to Kinko&#039;s and blow up that naked Ryan Kes pic up supersize/billboard style and hang it off the front of my house.  Yeah baby!!!

BTW, who&#039;s really reading that kid&#039;s book?  Kes or the puppet?  I think the puppet has more grey matter.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Next time any of you consider buying a Kelser jersey, just remember that you will look like this: http://img.allvoices.com/thumbs/image/609/609/82016393-vancouver-riot.jpg

And if you consider becoming a Canucks fan, based on the hotness of either Kesler or Bieksa, google the Sedins and stare into their CREEPY DEAD EYES. (Actually, Daniel Sedin is lovely... but we will ignore this fact). Come to think of it, there was a picture of Mason Raymond in the paper today looking quite dreamy...

NO.

STOP THIS.

GO BLACKHAWKS!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Linds;

Smack yourself hard in the face then look at Toews/Stamkos/Laich/The Professor/Letang to take the vision away.

It&#039;ll all be OK. It&#039;s nearly October...

PS if you&#039;re a Nucks fan then I apologize. Obviously. And to all Mucks fans. I&#039;ll pray for you... ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What a day... Kane on twitter, Kes naked in ESPN Magazine. Can it get any better? Well I have a few things in mind that could make this day epic, but I don&#039;t want to be greedy. :D]]></description>
