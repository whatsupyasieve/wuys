		<description><![CDATA[Jess, c&#039;mon, you&#039;re making us sound crazy. ;) OK, we are. Well worth being woken up for.
If there&#039;s Toews Tweets from Stalberg and Kane, I will ACTUALLY die.

And is that Joey in the stands???? HOCKEY SEASON, I LOVE YOU!

PS - Prayer circle for Ben F*cking Smith starting in 10 minutes.]]></description>

Sadly I&#039;m predicting this will last less time than Patrick Sharp on Twitter. Remember that? No, right? But I&#039;m really hoping he just OWNS, ignores the billions of lame douche tweets that are all &quot;Hey Kaner - I got 20c you can borrow.&quot; (There are already lots, I checked), and at some point tweets a picture of a sleeping Jonny Toews with the hastag:
