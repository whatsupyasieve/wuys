		<description><![CDATA[This ranking list cracks me up.  I think my blogging effects the universe because that&#039;s the only way Mike Green is #25.  (Opposite of 52 because there are no coincidences.  And there is no spoon.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What?  No faith in Chuck?  That hurts.  *right there*

While I LOVE me some Professor, he&#039;s not the sort of player that puts up stellar Fantasy points.  He does all the little things that make him an amazing two-way hockey player....just not when it comes to fantasy hockey.

Now if the rankings were for &quot;People I&#039;d want to have on my team if I were to suddenly become a NHL GM&quot;, Patrice would be right up there at the top!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[WHERE IS THE PROFESSOR?! Will throw down...

Can&#039;t play. Too easily confused by hockey terms and distracted by hotness. And I&#039;m chicken. Plus my money&#039;s on Pants (Sorry Chuck!)]]></description>
