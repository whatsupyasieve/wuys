		<description><![CDATA[Toews totally stole that post-it note from my desk. I knew I wasn&#039;t crazy!
That&#039;s the best caption photo of Tazer ever. Hands down.

I&#039;m really actually very sad they&#039;re not togethersies anymore. Will they still hang out and bromance together? Because you know bromance is more than just a noun, it&#039;s a way of life.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s to get more money out of you.

Getting excited about hockey. Almost as exciting as neurosurgery. Ok, that was a LIE. I have found two hockey fans in my department in the UK. Strangely, the Canadian dr is NOT a fan, so she should have her citizenship revoked IMMEDIATELY.

And. As always, I envy you your cable choices and time zone. I will be waiting to see what ESPN America deigns to show us Brits. Better be Bruins. And Pens. With some Laich, Talbot &#038; Greener :D Happy Cassy!]]></description>
