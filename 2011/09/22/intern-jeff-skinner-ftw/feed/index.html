		<description><![CDATA[I LOVE Cabbie! He always does the funniest interviews and videos. When I first watched this the other day I had to shut it off halfway through because I was in the library and I was having a hard time not laughing out loud.

I love Biz staring down the camera when talking about endurance. It would only have been better if he winked. Seguin&#039;s fractions and Stammer and Biz&#039;s high opinions of themselves are also prime.]]></description>
