		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] There are times I will reluctantly admit I like Alex Ovechkin.  It&#8217;s usually while leaping out of my seat at Verizon Center, trying not to toss my nachos on everyone.  This didn&#8217;t come easily to me &#8211; nor did becoming a Caps fan when I moved here &#8211; but sometimes&#8230; sometimes (when he wears shorts).

		<description><![CDATA[Great pics!  I think I saw Green when he first arrived, he was being escorted somewhere and he wasn&#039;t wearing a jersey yet.  He had on a plain orange t-shirt, don&#039;t think it was Ed Hardy, sorry.  It was hilarious because he passed a pack of teenage girls and they squealed and one ran up to him and asked for a hug and he gave her one.  She ran back to her pack and it was madness, they were all freaking out.]]></description>

Also, points for not dry-humping Backstrom. You make us fangirls look good.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jealous. Jealous. Jealous.

Sounds like you ladies had a fabulous time! The convention looks like a lot of fun. From all of the things I&#039;ve read, a lot of people&#039;s favorite thing was the Kids Press Conference. RussianMachineNeverBreaks.com has a bunch of videos from it and they&#039;re hilarious! The kids are so cute, and of course Carlzner never disappoints.]]></description>
