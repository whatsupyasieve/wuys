		<description><![CDATA[I believe that was also the same suit I snapped photos of him at the Blackhawks Convention that were posted here! Well if he&#039;s only going to wear one suit, at least he looks uber hot in it! Of course I would think he looks hot in well just about anything...and nothing!!

The socks are compression socks. I have a pair that I wear playing hockey. You can get them at any store that sells hockey equip or online. Of course I don&#039;t look nearly as sexy in them as Tazer does!

A report from Carolina...Intern Jeff Skinner took to the ice today in a red and white scrimmage game. I gues his teammates were telling some pretty funny jokes, because I have a lot of pictures with Jeff cracking up! I&#039;ll keep an eye on him to make sure he didn&#039;t get into the Mexi-colas!]]></description>

And here&#039;s another shot of the shirt - it&#039;s stating the obvious: http://lockerz.com/s/139238222]]></description>
