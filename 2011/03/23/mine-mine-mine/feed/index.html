		<description><![CDATA[Holy. Shit.

I&#039;m so jealous that I must now reveal this secret I&#039;ve been holding back just to try to make you jealous too.  Kris Letang shops at the same grocery store that I do.  Granted, I haven&#039;t seen him, but I&#039;ve heard the rumors.  So, you might have a signed puck, but one of these days I am totally going to make out with him in the produce aisle.]]></description>
