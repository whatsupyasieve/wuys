		<description><![CDATA[Now Jeff - Pants just moved herself across country and started a new job, plus she and the ladies went on an important fact-finding mission to Pittsburgh recently too.  There is only one of her!  And I&#039;m sure Dawn could NOT be spared from her Ovechtrick Fan Club duties: It&#039;s a lot of work for one woman.

We did notice you and I&#039;m sure they spotted all those squiggles on the whiteboard.  I did when I popped in to water the plants.  I wasn&#039;t sure what they were, but kudos to you on the math! It wasn&#039;t my strong point. Now biology on the other hand...

You&#039;re going to have a tough time making it to all those proms - have you ordered your powder-blue tux with the ruffled shirt yet? - and less of the digs about the year 1988. It was a VERY good year for all sorts of things. Crosby turned one, for one.

Now stop pouting - and whining - or we&#039;ll make you clean the WC for the next month. And ground you for prom.

PS Although you do win some brownie points for going all the way to Boston for my favorite sodas and buying the extra-large boxes of Junior Mints.  Your dedication is noted.]]></description>
