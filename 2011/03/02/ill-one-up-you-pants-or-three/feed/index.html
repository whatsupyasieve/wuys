		<description><![CDATA[Did I say Kessler was sexy? Did I? I only mentioned the slight possibility there might be a pic of him circulating the internet in only his briefs.  Let&#039;s just say the one WITHOUT the big black line through his, uh, er, cup area is vastly better, :D.

OK, OK, I admit it, the sight of that six pack may have made me drool a little.  Then I remembered I hadn&#039;t turned the page on my calendar and got to look at/ lust over the Professor all day. MUCH better.  Cassy must stay away from Nucks.]]></description>
