Or maybe that&#039;s the reason for the ritual shearing?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hair is SERIOUS business. SERIOUSLY PISSED. HA! Ovi has none now and he looks like he&#039;s two. NOT GOOD. He looked better a little scruffy. I like Special Pants/Hot Mop with his hair a little longer but I&#039;ll take what I can get. BTW - watching CBC right now and some Penguin walked right by the camera in his underwear - WHAT!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love you guys.  And I love this photo.  It cracks me up every time I see it.

And again, a Penguin gets a hair cut and there is serious flooding in Pittsburgh.  Come on guys.  You&#039;re wrecking our city with the tears of the women who love your hair.  Actually Letang&#039;s hair is fine.  I like it.  It was getting messy.  No shorter than that though.]]></description>
