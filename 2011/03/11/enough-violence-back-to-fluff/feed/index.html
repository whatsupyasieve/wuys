		<description><![CDATA[Haha. Wow, that is an unfortunate photo. Like athletes don&#039;t have enough of those just from getting caught making goofy faces mid-game.

Totally agree on the Hawks. Sharpy all the way. And Duncan Keith. But that&#039;s it. I am eternally baffled at the attention Kane and Toews get for anything but hockey. (Okay, and for Toews, his huge-even-by-hockey-standards behind.)

Dear Caps,
Stop being good looking. I am shallow and it makes it harder to dislike you.
Thanks.]]></description>
