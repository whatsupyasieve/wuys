		<description><![CDATA[There is no crying in Hockey. HA! And you will cheer because when he scores, it is nothing like you will EVER SEE AGAIN! You won&#039;t be able to help yourself like in SJ ... I saw you come out of your seat. ;) and you didn&#039;t even realize it until it was too late! You&#039;ve already come to the darkside. Not just because we have cookies!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can you silent cheer on Brooks too? I mean, I hate the team, but I love me some Mr Blue-Eyed Sex God.  Well and some Sad Panda too, but you have dibs on him and you don&#039;t like it when I get handsy Pants.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was there, and it was. Awesome.

The goal-less periods were torture but no hope was lost. The boo-ing was more torturous, if anything...I couldn&#039;t stand getting my boys booed. :(

But Brooks and Ovi pulled the magic out and made it happen! (Big shoutout to the new red-rockers, Arnott, Sturm and Wideman, who were big players in this game, too!)]]></description>
