		<description><![CDATA[Good luck with the root canal. I had one once when I was a kid. I fell asleep in the dentist&#039;s chair, so whatever they do to you it couldn&#039;t have been too bad. My dad freaked out and thought I&#039;d passed out though.

Domestic Duncan Keith with dog = adoooooorable and a very nice looking young man to boot. Playoff Duncan Keith with no teeth = homeless guy who panhandles for change outside the Tim Horton&#039;s.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh dear.  Duncs, that&#039;s not a good look.  Still, we all know he&#039;s waiting to retire before he gets himself those permanent implants.

Good luck today, Pants.  I feel for you.  Never had one (you&#039;d have to knock me out beforehand) and live in terror of it.

PS While recovering, look for Patrick Sharp introducing his dog, Shooter; the only dog in the WORLD that can raise one eyebrow and wipes off its own slobber... also on Hawks TV :D]]></description>
