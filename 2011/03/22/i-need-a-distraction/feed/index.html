		<description><![CDATA[I thought it might be Kunitz, but I think it&#039;s Ben Lovejoy actually.  And will you leave Jonathan Toews alone?! He&#039;s not going to eat a baby!  It&#039;s hard being 23, rich, a Cup champ, captain AND having to hang out with Patrick Kane all the time.  Imagine spending every waking moment with Stifler.  Jon is probably having his first intelligent conversation in months with that baby.  (Only kidding, loves to Kaner.  But really.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wanted to thank you gals for the website. I found you guys a couple of days ago while suffering through a horrible sinus infection. I think I went through your site for a couple hours and looking at hot hockey players eased the pain. Being a blackhawks, kings and capitals fan, it&#039;s a one stop shop. Keep up the good work!]]></description>
