		<description><![CDATA[Rumor is that Ovie had fluid drained out of his knee that has been bothering him since Matt Cooke kneed him.  He was seen limping this weekend.  I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s true, but I much rather have a healthy Ovie in the playoffs than have him play some mostly meaningless games now.  The Caps will have a playoff spot; they learned last year that seeding isn&#039;t so important.]]></description>
