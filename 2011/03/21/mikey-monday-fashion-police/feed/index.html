		<description><![CDATA[The one advantage to the homer Yankees hat is that it covers up his hairdo.  Although in his defense his hair has been looking better lately, maybe he has more time for haircuts since he&#039;s not traveling.  He wore that same hat on Christmas Eve at Nicky&#039;s house on 24/7.  Nicky should of snatched that hat and thrown it in the fireplace.

I don&#039;t think we&#039;ll be seeing Mike play anytime soon.  He hasn&#039;t been practicing recently, he was supposed to practice today but didn&#039;t.  He also hasn&#039;t participated in contact drills since he was hurt.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oi! I&#039;ve got 2 baseball hats like that! I feel for Fidget - uncontrollable hair is, well, uncontrollable. And I&#039;ve worn much worse especially when I&#039;m sick!

Ps I&#039;d wear the NY hat in Boston. I like living dangerously ;)]]></description>
