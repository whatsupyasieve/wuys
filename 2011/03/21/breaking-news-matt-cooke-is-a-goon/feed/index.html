		<description><![CDATA[I totally agree with you. He should be gone for all games the Pens play for the rest of this year. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I like a hard hit just as much as the next girl but I also like to see good players play out long careers. Not have those careers cut short because some hot head got his panties in a twist. Screw Matt Cooke, we don&#039;t need him or any player like him.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love the Pens, but personally, I think Cooke should be gone for the rest of the year. Cooke looked like he was ticked off getting the penalty...like he didn&#039;t get it. He made the Pens organization look like a bunch of idiots too. Their star player, the best player in the league is out because of a blow to the head and the owner has put his neck out there by saying teams should be monetarily penalized. So what does he do...elbow to the head. Better yet, the Pens should buy out his contract because at the rate he&#039;s going his fines will be the same amount as his contract.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[He made Ray Shero and Lemieux look like hypocrites. But whenever I think of what an ass he is, I can&#039;t help but think of him and his son on 24/7 and know that he has some redeeming qualities. (I am so naive.) Let&#039;s hope he makes those apparent after some time out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree.  The 5 minute major he took for this elbow cost the Pen the game vs. NYR.  And with so much of the lineup hurt, this is an asinine way to lose your seasoned guys.

I applaud Shero for publicly backing the decision.  Right to the part where he let Cooke wear the A on his jersey after returning from his previous suspension.  Pick a side, guys.  Or let Cooke keep effing around and he&#039;ll make the decision for you.]]></description>
