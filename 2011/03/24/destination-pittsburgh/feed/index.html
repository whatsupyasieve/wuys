		<description><![CDATA[Two ships passing in the night. I bet we were at some of the same games. I know how you feel, I don&#039;t understand why more women don&#039;t go to games, do they not know how many hot guys play hockey? Anywho, I have one hockey friend, and she&#039;s a Flyers fan. Next season, for sure!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cya, where were you when we both lived in LA and couldn&#039;t find anyone to go to hockey games with us?  Oh the drive to Anaheim.  Like a slow descent into hell.  But we&#039;re back pretty often to visit, so next season for sure!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so excited for you guys! As the lone Pens fan in Florida (apparently) I&#039;m loading up the car with one of my fellow hockey fan girlfriends and schlepping it down to Tampa to see the Pens play the Lightning one week from today! I hope to bring back a Tanger hair doll :)]]></description>
