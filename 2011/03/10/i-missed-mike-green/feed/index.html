		<description><![CDATA[I know the girl he was chatting with...Caps community relations director. We have a history together that has resulted in us never talking to each other EVER. What.The.Hell.

Lucky you that y&#039;all were that close to the game and to Mr. Pants for being thatclose to MG52. We don&#039;t see much up in the 400 level, other than the opposing team&#039;s scratches hanging out in the press both (HELLO Matt Gilroy)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t believe that you missed this!!!! Waaah.

Kudos to Mr. Pants. though, for thinking quickly on his feet.  Thanks to him you can watch the Canadian high-fives all day long.

Also, that suit = impeccable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[‚ÄúThis is how Canadians high-five.‚Äù
That&#039;s racist!

Okay, it&#039;s true. We are a nation of many fine traits, but &quot;smooth&quot; is not really one of them.


(BTW, I am so jealous that you guys actually get to go to games in person. Maybe someday I&#039;ll live in a city with a team. Well, a city with a team that doesn&#039;t have the highest ticket prices in the league.)]]></description>
