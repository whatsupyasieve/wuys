		<description><![CDATA[Jeff - we need to have a discussion about your moving the Junior Mints and chocolate cookies from their usual place in the staff kitchen cupboards and replacing them with protein bars. And can you also explain why all my favorite sodas have been replaced with Gatorade? And the blue one too.

We girls have needs. Do it again and I&#039;m replacing your cell phone ring tone with something tortuous by Justin Bieber or Whitney Houston. I can&#039;t be running out to the 7-eleven every time I stop by to visit the girls.

Ps you look totally FETCH in your little Jimmy costume! Wear it tomorrow, k?]]></description>
