		<description><![CDATA[Dorksquad Express!  Man I almost commented 10 times but it was too good to stop the video.

1) Crosby, @jfrancesw is right.  You&#039;re looking a bit wide.
2) Brooks Orpik - even when you can only see one eye, it&#039;s a CRAZY eye.
3) Disco Dan - Hat OR shirt, not both.  Go easy.
4) What&#039;s with all the hats and bad lighting?  Did Kaner shoot this on his Flipcam?
5) Sid. Snacks.
6) I love this team, I really do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just noticed that if the BACK UP goalie can appear in the commerical than Letang should be there. He&#039;s done an awesome job for them with all the injuries. He went to the All-Star game. And don&#039;t ask me how I know that many Penguins. ;) Just Sayin.]]></description>
