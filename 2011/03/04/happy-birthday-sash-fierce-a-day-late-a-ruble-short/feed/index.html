		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t get versus ... and all the pens games seem to be on versus so I would have to go a bar so see them and that would be a bad mix for anyone else ha! especially if Le Bang lost his jersey! I would be in JAIL! HA! I did hear about that. I am sure he is feeling the pressure right now having to carry the team with everyone out - he&#039;s got to get it out some how and since he doesn&#039;t have access to all of us - ;) I guess it&#039;s gonna BLOW (ha!) on the ice. Be sure I will do a post on it. Just had to get Sasha his belated B-day shout.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[And if we can make this about actual hockey for a minute - what the hell was he doing fighting anyway?  I mean yeah, there&#039;s this thrilling moment when you realize &quot;OH MY GOD LETANG IS GOING TO FIGHT!&quot; and then you remember you want the Pens to actually win the game and all of our star players are already injured.  When he started throwing punches at the other guy&#039;s helmet I nearly died.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[LePretty does seem to be losing his clothes on a regular basis on any occasion these days.

Game misconduct was prolly for causing mass fainting of women spectators.

Someone told him we likey likey his sex hair, pecs &#038; abs huh?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey, I don&#039;t see an email address for you guys, but I have some important Pens updates for you:

Jordan Staal cut his hair.  Meanwhile, flood warnings have been issued in Pittsburgh.  Related, or not?

And secondly, Kris Letang was thrown out of a game for a wardrobe malfunction.  He allowed another man to remove his jersey during a fight.  Actually, it was because he didn&#039;t have his jersey tied down properly - how in the hell is this a game misconduct?  Seriously, NHL, that&#039;s total crap.  Anyway, this happened at the beginning of a game against the Devils, which we went on to lose, which is probably partially Letang&#039;s fault.  But it is hard to be mad at him when he was being all feisty and undressed.]]></description>
