		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m probably the only one whose first thought was &quot;Take it easy, Sidney! Don&#039;t let everyone pressure you if you still don&#039;t feel right!&quot;

I mean, it&#039;s good that he&#039;s skating again. I just don&#039;t want to see any Marc Savard scenario again. Plus, the people of Cole Harbour might have to go back to being known for racial tensions instead of Sid, and that would suck for them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Same here - there was much rejoicing at my desk.  There aren&#039;t many hockey fans in my office, so I ran across the hall to the one person who I knew would care and we freaked out together.  It was a beautiful moment.

And don&#039;t worry about Letang.  Anybody else would probably miss a few games after that hit, but not Letang.  How many times have we seen him leave the ice with some kind of injury only to reappear a few minutes later?  He&#039;s like the toughest guy ever.]]></description>
