		<description><![CDATA[No &#039;Arn City in the fridge, but I did have some when I was in PA (at Shiloh Grill, which is a must-go.  Reading the menu is an adventure.  And funny too!)

My babcia makes some bomb pierogies.  Pan fried with some butter and onions/bacon....hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah, Pierogies or &quot;Klassu&quot; (as my Lithuanian G&#039;ma calls em&#039;), the food that could have prevented many wars. There are these old school Polish Catholics in Pittsbugh that make homemade pierogies in the church basement. My friends and I would go down their on a Saturday afternoon, but a trunkload, go back to the house, get stoned and eat potato and cheese pierogies till we passed out in a THC &#038; food induced coma. What&#039;s up with no &quot;Arn City&quot; Beer in the frig? Not classy enough for the luxury box?]]></description>

TheChad just needs to make friends with the guy who owned the luxury box we were in, so we can go to games whenever we want!]]></description>
