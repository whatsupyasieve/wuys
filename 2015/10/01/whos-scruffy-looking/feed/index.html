		<description><![CDATA[THE PITTSBURGH TEN!!!! YAS.

I&#039;ll say it again, Pants - guaranteed a woman organized those shots of the Islanders. When else would black and white, gritty photography and dewy skin be the go-to for headshots? (Bless her, whomever she is)

And I&#039;ve saved that pic of Sid on every device, every computer I access. Bless YOU, Pants!]]></description>
