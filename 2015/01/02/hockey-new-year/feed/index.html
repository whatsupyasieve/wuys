		<description><![CDATA[Pants, that&#039;s a great hat.  

As for low ratings, I definitely blame college football. I spent the game flipping back and forth between the Winter Classic and the Wisconsin-Auburn game, which annoyed the bejesus out of my hungover friends.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t believe they ran out of food. Lame! I&#039;ve been to 5 outdoor games (1 WC, 2 Stadium Series &#038; 2 AHL) and that&#039;s never happened. Even at the 2 AHL games in Rochester -- where it was so cold that they only had port-o-potties because the pipes were too frozen to turn on the water at the park -- there was plenty of food and drink.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great Post! Everything about it was great especially the photo captions. I always love reading about the games you actually attend/road trip posts because they are so thorough. 

LMAO @ I hadnâ€™t eaten in hours and wished they would launch hot dogs into the air instead.]]></description>
