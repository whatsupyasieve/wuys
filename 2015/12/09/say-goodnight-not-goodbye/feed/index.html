		<description><![CDATA[This beats ANY Buzzfeed list. I can&#039;t decide which one is my favourite! You look like the perfect compliment to Duper, Pants - I feel as giddy as you look! But nothing beats Duper&#039;s dad love for guys like Nealer and Sid. He&#039;ll be missed... :(]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Duper... always so desperate to play. This is just heartbreaking to me because through his interviews and the pieces he has written for the Players&#039; Tribune, I just know how much this must be killing him. And he has always been such a locker room presence, I honestly feel like Crosby really needs him around at this point. I just hope they keep him around and helping in some way. Throughout the years, it has been easy to pick up on just how great of a teammate he has been--the affection the other players have for him is palpable. I&#039;m glad he was on our team, and I&#039;ll miss having him on the ice. :(]]></description>
