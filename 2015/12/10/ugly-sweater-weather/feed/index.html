I&#039;ve been laughing at this line for 10 minutes...&quot;did his contract allow the NHL to put his image on ‚Äúurinal cakes or Christmas sweaters, but not both‚Äù, and he‚Äôd been hopefully searching for his face in every bar bathroom in Chicago?&quot;

It&#039;s things like this that are the reason we&#039;re friends]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I want all the Bruins ugly stuff. It will go with my truly hideous Bruins winter hat. I know my friend Sanna would also like it - it will go well with her Bruins scarf and mittens that I got her in Boston as a Christmas gift.

Which she was totally delighted with. I had to stop her stealing my hat.

PS she and her husband have truly hideous winter wear for a local Scottish team, the Braemore Clan. Fortunately my local team haven&#039;t yet got in the swing of merchandising yet.

PS 2 - a sweater with BERGY on it? Be still my beating heart!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t lie - I kinda like the Ugly Sweater Mug. Only $7.99 AND you can take the ugly sweater off it if you want? Not a bad deal. Hahaha]]></description>
