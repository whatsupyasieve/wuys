		<description><![CDATA[My lovely Habs because as you mentioned above Carey Price. If Max Pacioretty is healthy have fun beating Canadiens #GoHabsGo 
I really hope Pens can pull it but Rangers look strong maybe this time it will other way around where Rangers were up 3-1 and Pens took the series from there.
I feel bad for Steve Yzerman. Lightning are fast not reliant on Steven Stamkos this season. The 2nd line is AMAZING.
Probably Caps for that one. JT cannot carry his team against Holty &#038; Co.
That&#039;s it for me.]]></description>
