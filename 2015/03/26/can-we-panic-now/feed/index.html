		<description><![CDATA[I love this post. I am right there with you on the pizzas and am so nervous for the two Pens vs. Flyers games it is not funny. They cannot afford (literally cannot afford) to lose any (more) players - especially defensemen. GAH!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To quote Jean Ralphio, this end of the season stuff is the WOOOOOOOOORST.  I just look at the standings and cringe and panic, knowing that it&#039;s not going to get easier.  Because next is the stress-ball that is the playoffs and then potential elimination (and I don&#039;t want to be a naysayer but the Pens in the playoffs just makes me feel ill with worry.)  And then it&#039;s the off-season and I&#039;m stuck watching baseball instead.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Abbey! I have considered this and hope that Tavares will get nominated for other things. Then he&#039;ll wear a suit and write a speech, but not be sure he&#039;ll have to give it. Extra nervous = extra cute. Everybody wins (but mostly us). Right?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m going to cheerfully ignore the Bruins dig to disagree with you on Crosby winning the scoring race. I love him too, but it would be nice to see John Tavares get some more love from the league. Plus, if he wins the Art Ross, we get to see him in a nice suit and he&#039;ll have to make a speech.]]></description>
