		<description><![CDATA[Well... I&#039;m Canadian so I already had my Thanksgiving, but I&#039;m grateful for the 9-game winning streak by Habs, PKane&#039;s ongoing 18-game point streak. You guys are amazing. You guys prove that girls can be the biggest fan of Hockey too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m thankful Bergeron did a Movember to spot for Visa Canada. I&#039;m thankful Kris Letang is alive. 

I&#039;m thankful for two of the funniest bloggers in hockey being my friends!

And I&#039;m thankful Intern Jeff Skinner keeps my drawer stocked with watchamacallit bars and knows to fix my coffe and throw chocolate at me from a safe distance when I&#039;m in that sort of a &quot;mood&quot;.

Happy Thanksgiving!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am thankful to be able to see the Wild on the road this year and being closer to my goal of watching them play in every arena. After this trip, I will be down to 5 arenas. I am also thankful for WUYS, it makes me laugh and I really enjoy the site. Happy Thanksgiving.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am grateful that most of my teams are doing well. I am thankful, as always, for middle school science teacher John Tavares. I am thankful that Tyler Seguin is playing hockey that is as pretty as he is. I am thankful that Ovi is Ovi. Above all, I am thankful for goalies. Especially Henrik Lundqvist and Brayden Holtby for setting the bar for good hair.

Happy Thanksgiving to you guys, my favorite hockey bloggers. I know you guys are going to be so full that you won&#039;t want to do anything, but don&#039;t make Intern Jeff Skinner do all the hard work, after all, interns get Thanksgiving too!]]></description>

I&#039;m also grateful for the existence of the NWHL and the opportunities that it presents!
