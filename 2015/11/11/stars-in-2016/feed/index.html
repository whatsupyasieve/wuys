		<description><![CDATA[As always, this is high quality content ladies! The Stars are looking a lot like the Hawks did a few years ago, before 2010. Young talent, good free agent signings, a loose and committed locker room (funny video content included). It will be interesting to see if the equation produces results for the club, and in the meantime I will continue to enjoy what the Stars are selling. TS has been a favorite of mine for years, and he has really become quite the player and person.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am having a &quot;get me a vodka and Xanax smoothie right now&quot; kind of day, and then just like that, WUYS bestows this gift upon us. I&#039;m so grateful I&#039;m even willing to overlook that snide Rangers comment.

My public service is to inform you that said calendar, which will benefit the Dallas Stars Foundation, will be available online on November 21st. I know this because I begged the foundation via Twitter to tell me how those of us who don&#039;t live in Dallas could get one. You&#039;re welcome.

Seriously, though, this post is magnificent. Bless you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, when you break it down, the Stars are worth rooting for for the same reason the Penguins were a few years back (and to a lesser extent, still are, because their depth has suffered since).  That&#039;s because their uptempo style of play is hugely entertaining, even moreso when a team like that can roll four lines.

Ultimately, these kinds of &quot;fun to watch&quot; teams are good for the sport as a whole.  These are the teams you show friends who you&#039;re trying to bring over to hockey fandom.]]></description>
