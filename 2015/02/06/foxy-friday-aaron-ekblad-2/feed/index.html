		<description><![CDATA[First of all, I&#039;m not ashamed to admit that I squeaked to see my reply tweet actually shown on your blog. ::fangirls::
Second, I do somewhat follow the Panthers because of Roberto Luongo, so I had the slight advantage of going through all of these stages of amazement and discovery several months ago. That doesn&#039;t mean that I understand how he exists any better, though. 
Third, I thought it was really cool that he and Tavares were the only two players granted  exceptional player status (until McDavid and the new guy).
Fourth, I cannot comprehend sitting next to him in a classroom.  Nope.
Lastly, Willie Mitchell&#039;s tweets about him were the final straw. I gave up. I mean, baking cookies for a road trip!  While giving the camera a doofy thumb&#039;s up! He&#039;s clearly a governmental science experiment, or the next gen version of the Canadian hockey robot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How is he that young?! How does he not look completely awkward just like any other 18 year old?

Great Foxy Friday pick!

Also, apparently he knows how to juggle, as demonstrated here:

		<description><![CDATA[He does look better than he should for being 18.

Also, I LOVE Filip Forsberg, but he wasn&#039;t traded for nothing. Part of the package was Michael Latta whom I think should be a future Foxy Friday, just saying.  (Or a joint one with him and his bromance Tom Wilson. Did you see them in the Road to the Winter Classic? Pretty, pretty stupid boys.)]]></description>
