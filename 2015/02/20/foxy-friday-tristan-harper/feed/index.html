		<description><![CDATA[Hang on a minute.... You didn&#039;t know we have hockey in Scotland? I thought you and I had established this, over pints in many bars in Boston? You mean, we never had the discussion about me seeing my first hockey player, aged six and thinking HOLEEEEEEEE SHEEEEEEEEEEET? 

My friend Sanna (Braehead fan, sitting beside me, who is flabbergasted you picked one of her boys for this honour) and her man (both just back from their first Beantown visit) will take you to a game next time you&#039;re here. And you can stay with me in Edinburgh. Also in Scotland.]]></description>
