		<description><![CDATA[I think the Pens players should lobby to wear their own clothes next year--or we should lobby on behalf of them.  Those vests are so very bridal party-esque and they look scratchy as all get out.  (The ridiculous clip on matching bowties are giving me a flashback to my senior prom (Can You Feel the Love Tonight!)   I mean, the Stars looked gooood, and I&#039;m sure the Pens would gladly step up their game.

All of this just makes me miss Katie O&#039;Malley.  Celina&#039;s just not the same.  She makes me nervous.]]></description>
