		<description><![CDATA[I had to pause the two minute long video SIX times because the cuteness was just too overwhelming.  Everything about that was just too absolutely adorable.  

Oh my gosh.  Just stop BHTV.  Stahp.  (Don&#039;t stop.  Keep those videos coming.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Captain Everything showing everybody else how to do it right! It&#039;s endearingly adorable that he screws up the patch and then insists on correcting it. Even Captain Perfection can&#039;t iron right the first time around. Puppies, kids, and the big kid that is Andrew Shaw just put this video on overload. BHTV showing that they still know how to make us crazy and that they are still the best in the biz. This in combination with the PSA video are killing me right now.]]></description>
