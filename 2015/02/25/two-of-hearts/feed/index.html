		<description><![CDATA[I know this is an older post, but I just found it and I love it. 
As you can see from my username, I&#039;m a 2-team girl. Glad to know I&#039;m not the only one.

The Wild are my #1 team, the ones I cry about when they get eliminated from the playoffs. When I watch games (online), they&#039;re generally who I pick. Plus, the roster doesn&#039;t drastically change very often (sometimes I&#039;m not sure if this is a good or a bad thing), so I feel like I really &quot;know&quot; the Wild players who come back year after year.

But at the same time, I really like the Pens as my #2. They&#039;re fun to follow even though I don&#039;t get as emotionally invested in how they&#039;re doing. 

My excuse is that they&#039;re in different conferences and never play each other more than a few times a year. Plus, having two teams just makes things more fun. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been reading your blog for quite a while, but have never responded before.  So I hope it is ok to add my take. 
I actually have five teams, which can get kind of awkward.  My number one team is the Sharks, they are my closest team geographically (and yet still 5 hours away) and also really good at breaking my heart.  Number two is the Rangers - I can&#039;t help but rooting for Marc Staal, Number three Hurricanes - can&#039;t leave the other Staals out. Number four - Blackhawks - how can you not root for Kane and Toews, and number five - Brooks Laich&#039;s blue eyes (er I mean Capitals).  Sorry, what can I say, I&#039;m kind of shallow. :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, I have two favourite teams - the Leafs and the Pens.  The Leafs because I have been a life long fan and it&#039;s kinda like a marriage even though it sucks at times and it&#039;s a struggle with all ups and downs, especially with this team, but you still believe, you still stick with the Leafs.  Although they are having a dismal year (or years) they will always be my team but since 2008 the Pens have been closing the gap.  When the Leafs and Pens face each other I hope for a tie so at least each team gets a point.  However, when they do play each other I find myself cheering more so for the Pens than Leafs.  So does that make me more of a Pens fan?  But I get more angry when the Leafs lose.  Weird.  When it comes to the playoffs I tend to cheer for the Canadian teams (except Ottawa).  I never really hated the Habs like some Leaf fans do, I respected them and loved the rivalry.  Will always hate the Flyers and Senators.  haha]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two days late to this party (Thank GOD the Pens pulled that one out!!), but it&#039;s timely because my mom had a discussion on Facebook yesterday with one particular jagoff who didn&#039;t understand the #TwoOfHearts phenomenon. Obviously, I sent her the link to this post &#038; told her to post it &#038; tag him so he can see for himself that LOTS of people have love for multiple teams!

As for me &#038; my house, we are Pens fans first, last, &#038; ALWAYS. I was an Undergrad at Pitt when they won back-to-back Lord Stanleys &#038; I even got to see Mario &#038; Jagr play at the Igloo (Civic Arena) once. The first time I visited the Burgh, I lost my heart and have never gotten it back. To be clear, I don&#039;t even WANT it back - Pittsburgh is amazing! &quot;Whatever it takes, We walk Together,&quot; is one of the team&#039;s unofficial mottoes and that&#039;s how I look at my fandom of all things Penguins.

The clear Number 2 in our house is the Blackhawks. Because of WUYS &#038; BHTV. And Captain Serious/Not-So-Serious/Perfect. Nuff said.

Beyond that, since we have Center Ice, we watch A LOT of hockey &#038; catch a lot more  Western Conference games since they don&#039;t often conflict with Pens games. One of my favorite non-Pens is Kopitar. We root for Ben Lovejoy because he used to be a Penguin &#038; are glad to see him playing regularly &#038; doing well. I am ALWAYS begging Chris Higgins to pull up his jersey &#038; show me those glorious abs (Thanks, WUYS!), although I&#039;m not a fan of the Nucks. 

One thing that is 100% clear, though, is that the Hockey FAMILY is one of the greatest things on earth!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[THANK YOU! I hate being questioned about liking multiple teams.
People never understand why I like Chicago because I&#039;m not even from there, but it started off as an appreciation of individual player talent and then grew into a love for the team as a unit and let&#039;s be real... the BHTV videos would win anyone over. I was born and raised a Buffalo fan, but I&#039;ve gotten into Dallas in the last couple years as well since I have a friend that lives in the area and we go to games when I visit. I&#039;ll root for pretty much any team as long as it isn&#039;t Philly (sorry not sorry Flyers fans).
Thankfully my poor split emotions don&#039;t really have to worry about loyalties during play off season since only Chicago usually ever makes it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Stars all seem like they&#039;re all just really great friends who have fun and chirp each other but also care about each other, and that&#039;s kind of irresistible to watch.  I mean, Jason Demers joins the team and is immediately welcomed into this little family of players.  I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s their PR department or if it just naturally happened, but it&#039;s so fun to watch.  

Also, I love Julie Dobbs, the Stars Insider reporter, and I&#039;m so happy to see her recovering and back doing such good work.

I just have a lot of Stars feels.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have this problem where I always have to have three teams that I follow kind of regularly. It happened in baseball (which is where I&#039;ve spent most of my sports fan life, 2nd is AHL hockey because my hometown has a team, NHL has only taken up about three years of my life) and sadly it has followed me to the NHL.

I&#039;m kind of the opposite of you on rule three though. While I root for the Blackhawks to beat basically anyone on any given day, when they play the Stars or the Oilers I sometimes want the other team to win if they need it more. Now, my feelings on this are shifting right now because of the devastation that is Patrick Kane out for three months, but last season when the Stars were scratching and clawing and the Blackhawks were sitting pretty, I wore a Stars shirt under a Blackhawks hoodie to a game at the UC and silently rooted for the Stars the whole time. SOMETIMES THE UNDERDOGS NEED POINTS MORE OKAY

Anyway. I&#039;m glad that there are so many people that love multiple teams, because if one more person questions my love for any of my three teams I might have to get feisty like Tom Wilson all over them. And not in a sexy way, though he&#039;s totally capable of that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[JT for the win! I don&#039;t like Ovi, which I didn&#039;t even mention in my Caps missive above, but there is definitely a school of thought for supporting a team without loving (or liking) every player - even superstars. I like when he scores goals, of course, and helps them win (when I want them to win, that is). But overall? Nope.]]></description>

I needed a Western team for the first time ever, and the AMP line was just so exciting. Plus, they won a Cup that year.

		<description><![CDATA[I am in the same boat. When we lost the North Stars in Minnesota, I needed a new team. Having watched Detroit because of their Russian Five in the 90&#039;s and being Intrigued by that (I was studying Russian History at the time) I easily picked the Red Wings. Michigan is close to Minnesota too, so that is a plus. When Minnesota got our new team, all my friends and family gave me grief, telling me I had to like and root only for the Wild. I told them no. I am Detroit #1, Minnesota #2 and that is how it will stay. I rock my Wings gear when they come to town and rock my Wild gear at all other games. I still get the occasional band wagon fan comment or Detroit sucks (that is a favorite one of other hockey fans) I just let it go.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Favourite teams: 1. Montreal. Always #GoHabsGo
                            2.Chicago (favourite American team)
                            3.Pens
                            4.Rangers
 Loathed teams (not in order)
                            1.Philly
                            2.Isles (but I LOVE JT)
                            3.Caps (but I like Ovi)
                            4.Toronto (don&#039;t care)
I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;m the only Habs fan residing in Toronto and there has been chirps and arguments but I&#039;m adamant for my loyalty. I always think of ranking my favourite teams as a draft.]]></description>
