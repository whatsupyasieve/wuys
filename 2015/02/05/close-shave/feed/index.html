		<description><![CDATA[1. This is the ONLY good thing (for me) to come from the Patriots winning. I&#039;ve missed Jordie&#039;s face.

2. Did you catch this exchange in that video?
Tyler: Will this affect our friendship?
Jordie: No
Tyler: Promise?
Jordie: Yeah

PROMISE? And he said it in front of the entire locker room and cameras? Precious.

3. Inquiring minds want to know the details of the bet between Tyler and Jamie (there had to be one, right?).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So my Tyler Seguin thoughts revolve around wanting him to safe and happy and cared for (my Jamie Benn thoughts are, on the other hand, less pure), and the part at around 1:40 where he asked Jordie if this was going to going to affect their friendship made me just want to pull him into a hug and pet his (thankfully intact) hair.  Was he kidding?  Probably?  Did it still hit me right in the &quot;Protect Tyler Seguin&quot; feels?  Yup.]]></description>
