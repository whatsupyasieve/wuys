		<description><![CDATA[No Jagr mullet??? For shame! Also, Brent Burns: I&#039;m all-in for the Chewie look. It works for him. I would also like to note that for the last game of the season, Jordie was rocking Jamie&#039;s haircut. Matching tattoos AND matching haircuts? STOP IT, you two.

My thoughts... Jamie: #2 (and I really cannot stress just how much this works for me - LORD, does it work for me); Tom: #2; Hags: #1 (there IS such a thing as too much flow); Stammer: anything except #2 - you are NOT a member of the Patridge family, Steven; Girioux: #1; Letang: #2 - I never thought he was anything special until he cut his hair and voila! Bonjour, monsieur.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Too funny!  Love the take you have on all things NHL.  I think everyone&#039;s hair is evolving nicely, with the exception of Giroux.  I just don&#039;t understand him.  But then, he&#039;s a Flyer, so I don&#039;t have to. :)]]></description>
