		<description><![CDATA[I love Two Bearded Ladies!  Their &quot;Let Me Tell You About My Aesthetic&quot; series is fantastic.

I feel like the Stars PR/marketing/social media department really needs to focus on Patrick Sharp&#039;s snarky, sarcastic side.  Sure, he&#039;s a pretty face, but he&#039;s also kind of a sarcastic hellion.  Pair him up with Demers, who just seems like an annoying shit (but, you know, in a good way!) and watch the magic happen.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OMG Stephen Johns!!!! Oh how I&#039;ve missed him! I was seriously devastated when he got packaged in the Sharp deal. Texas, please take care of him, he is beautiful and super sweet. Last year, I got to bowl with him at a charity event and he bought pitchers of beer for our group, as well as being all-around awesome and funny. When he makes the NHL, I am in full agreement that he will immediately need a Foxy Friday - he&#039;s absolutely gorgeous. I&#039;m super bummed that he&#039;s been sent down already, I was hoping to see him when the Stars come to Chicago for the final preseason game. Being that it&#039;s an away for the Stars, I don&#039;t know how many of their prettiest/big name players will actually be there, but if they show up I&#039;ll try to get pictures.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi ladies!!  Thank you very much for the shout-out, it means a lot coming from such an amazing blog as this.  Hockey women gotta stick together!  With so much vitriol being spat at women who write/blog about sports lately, it&#039;s great when we can support each other. And we&#039;ve been a fan of this blog for a long time.  It was also so much fun to get to hang out with Merrin and Carolyn for a couple of days. Love their stuff too, and we gotta order some merch from them.  And of course, our partner in crime Brenda, with her amazing camera (that ab shot of Seggy alone was worth the trip).  Can&#039;t wait for the season to begin!  #isitOctoberyet]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;You miss 100% of the abs you never show.&quot; 

I prostrate myself before your genius. That is officially going straight into my quote book.

Thanks again for letting me be a part of the WUYS magic (and for allowing the pro-Rangers propaganda to get through the censors).]]></description>
